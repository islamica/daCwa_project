BIO: He is the brother-in-law of Ḥamdānủȵ Ḳarmaṭủȵ [[حمدان قرمط]] and like him comes from Ḳussủ Bahrāmỉȵ [[قس بهرام]] close to Bābil [[بابل]]. They are converted together by al-Ḥusaynủ al-ʾAhwāziyyủ [[الحسين الأهوازي]] either in 261AH or 264AH. Following this they head the mission in al-Sawādủ [[السواد]], with ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]] focussing on the rural areas. From his converts he appoints a head dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] for each district that each have a number of duʿāŧủȵ [[دعاة]]. Among the bedouins he is likewise successful, the majority of them joins al-daʿwaŧủ [[الدعوة]]. From the converts he and his brother-in-law collect taxes in the name of the promised al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]], that are either sent to Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] or saved locally, they enjoin on their followers the principle of al-ʾulfaŧủ [[الألفة]], meaning that everyone has to share their material belongings with all the other believers, and from 276AH they command them to buy and secretly store weapons. During all this ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]] is in close contact with the al-Ḥuǧǧaŧủ [[الحجة]] ʾAbū al-Šalaġlaġỉ [[أبو الشلغلغ]] in Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] via carrier pigeons. In the year 277AH or 279AH he begins to fortify a dārủ al-hiǧraŧỉ [[دار الهجرة]] in the village Mahtamābādủ [[مهتماباد]] in the province al-Furātủ [[الفرات]] close to al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]]. Only during summer 284AH the gouvernor of al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]] starts to approach the ʾismāʿīliyyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] villages in al-Sawādủ [[السواد]] militarilly and sends some of the arrested ʾIsmāʿīliyyūnả [[إسماعيليون]] to Baġdādủ [[بغداد]]. From the interrogations it becomes apparent that the connections of Ḥamdānủȵ Ḳarmaṭủȵ [[حمدان قرمط]] and ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]] even reached officials in Baġdādủ [[بغداد]]. When ʾAbū al-Šalaġlaġỉ [[أبو الشلغلغ]] passes away in 286AH, his brother-in-law becomes suspicious of the true intentions of Saʿīdủȵ bnủ al-Ḥusaynỉ [[سعيد بن الحسين]], his successor as al-Ḥuǧǧaŧủ [[الحجة]], and sends ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]] to the headquarters in Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]]. After it becomes clear to him that Saʿīdủȵ bnủ al-Ḥusaynỉ [[سعيد بن الحسين]] isn’t advancing the cause of the hidden al-ʾImāmủ [[الإمام]] Muḥammadủȵ bnủ ʾIsmāʿīlả [[محمد بن إسماعيل]] but considers himself as the true al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]] he and his brother-in-law instruct all the duʿāŧủȵ [[دعاة]] in al-Sawādủ [[السواد]] to suspend al-daʿwaŧủ [[الدعوة]] and the schism of al-Ḳarmaṭiyyūnả [[القرمطيون]] ensues. He is later visited by an envoy from Saʿīdủȵ bnủ al-Ḥusaynỉ [[سعيد بن الحسين]], probably a brother of his, who tries to win back his loyalty. When he doesn’t succeed he incites Zakarūyaŧủȵ bnủ Mihrūyaŧỉȵ [[زكروية بن مهروية]], a son of one of ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]]’s first followers, to plotting his murder. This plot succeeds and followers of Zakarūyaŧủȵ bnủ Mihrūyaŧỉȵ [[زكروية بن مهروية]] from the clan Tamīmủȵ [[تميم]] of the tribe Kulaybủȵ [[كليب]] who live west of al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]] kill him during a night in his home in the village Nāsūrā [[ناسورا]]. At least until 315AH his followers still act in the name of the hidden al-ʾImāmủ [[الإمام]] Muḥammadủȵ bnủ ʾIsmāʿīlả [[محمد بن إسماعيل]], have scriptures with his alleged authorship circulate and believe that he is still alive.
