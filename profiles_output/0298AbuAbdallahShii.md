BIO: ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] hails from al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]] where he and his by one year older brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] are recruited by a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]]. When he was sent to al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] in Egypt, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] and ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] accompany him, with ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] being his envoy to Ibnủ Ḥawšabỉȵ [[ابن حوشب]] in al-Yamanủ [[اليمن]]. In 278AH he leaves Egypt on pilgrimage, and from al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]] continues on with yamanīyủȵ [[يمني]] pilgrims to al-Yamanủ [[اليمن]]. After nearly a year as a student of Ibnủ Ḥawšabỉȵ [[ابن حوشب]], in 279AH, he goes back to Egypt, again via al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]]. In Miná [[منى]] near al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]] he and his companion meet pilgrims from the berber clan Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] close to al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧủ [[القسطنطينة]], some of whom are also šīʿīyūnả [[شيعيون]]. They travel together to Egypt and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] manages to gain their trust. He learns that they live more or less independent from any authority since they live in a remote region, are large in number and well-versed in fighting. They ask ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] to come with them and be a teacher among them and although outwardly reluctant he agrees. Via Ṭarābulusủ [[طرابلس]] and the oases in Šaṭṭủ al-Ǧarīdỉ [[شط الجريد]] the caravan reaches Sūǧmārủ [[سوجمار]] and in early 280AH he enters the Small Kabylia and takes residence in ʾĪkǧānủ [[إيكجان]] close to Mīlā [[ميلا]] west of al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧủ [[القسطنطينة]] where the Banū Saktānỉȵ [[بنو سكتان]] from the tribe Ǧīmalaŧủȵ [[جيملة]] live. Here he starts holding meetings of wisdom (maǧālisủ al-ḥikmaŧỉ [[مجالس الحكمة]]), which he and his brother continue to hold even after Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] is conquered, and he starts to spread his ʾismāʿīlīyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] beliefs; very soon this is the topic of speculation among the surrounding villages. During all this ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has regular contact with ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] in al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] and with the headquarters in Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]]. Very soon the pressure becomes to high and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to find a new refuge, he finds it with the Banū Ġašmānỉȵ [[بنو غشمان]] in Tāzrūtủ [[تازروت]] where he constructs a dārủ al-hiǧraŧỉ [[دار الهجرة]]. There he gathered strength for several years, so that when the rulers of the three cities Mīlā [[ميلا]], Saṭīfủȵ [[سطيف]] and Bilizmaŧủȵ [[بلزمة]] unite with the not yet converted Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] his men win the battle. Following this he can convince many more of the berbers of the region to join his cause, the ʾIǧǧānaŧủȵ [[إجانة]], the Laṭāyaŧủȵ [[لطاية]], the Ǧīmalaŧủȵ [[جيملة]], the Malūsaŧủȵ [[ملوسة]], the Danhāǧaŧủȵ [[دنهاجة]], the ʾŪrīsaŧủȵ [[أوريسة]] and the Masāltaŧủȵ [[مسالتة]] who had been ḫāriǧīyūnả [[خارجيون]]. ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] divides the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] in seven, raises an army from each of these seven groups and appoints a leader for each. He claims no portion in the war loot and promotes asceticism and selfless mutual help. Only after being urged to he takes one of the captured slaves as his wife who carries his son. His reign also includes the application of harsh ḥaddủȵ [[حد]] punishments as well as punishments of shunning and exilation according to the degree of the misconduct. In 289AH his men conquer the first city in the region, Mīlā [[ميلا]], however, it is reconquered in the same year in Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧỉ [[ذو القعدة]] by al-ʾAġlabīyūnả [[الأغلبيون]]. They can even drive the ʾismāʿīlīyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] troops away from Tāzrūtủ [[تازروت]] and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to take up camp in ʾĪkǧānủ [[إيكجان]] again. In the wake of the murder of the reigning ʾamīrủȵ [[أمير]] on 28th Šaʿbānủ [[شعبان]] of 290AH and the ensuing struggle of his son Ziyādaŧủ Allãhỉ [[زيادة الله]] to stabilize his power, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] can regain Mīlā [[ميلا]] and even seizes control of Saṭīfủȵ [[سطيف]] at the end of 291AH. After the city’s governour’s passing away a berber of the tribe Lahīṣaŧủȵ [[لهيصة]] gives the city away. In fall 292AH / 293AH, al-ʾAġlabīyūnả [[الأغلبيون]] try another military advance against the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] berbers, however they are defeated shortly after leaving al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧủ [[القسطنطينة]]. When Saʿīdủȵ bnủ al-Ḥusaynỉ al-Mahdīyủ [[سعيد بن الحسين المهدي]] comes to Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]] in Morocco, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] regularly exchanges letters with him urging him to come forth, which al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] refuses though. ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] even sends a military expedition of 100 men to Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]], but they don’t come through. In the following years he can expand and conquer Ṭubnaŧủȵ [[طبنة]] and Bilizmaŧủȵ [[بلزمة]]. In Ṭubnaŧủȵ [[طبنة]] he abrogates all forms of taxes that are not grounded in al-Ḳurʾānủ [[القرآن]]. In Šaʿbānủ [[شعبان]] of 294AH some of the people of Bāġāyaŧủȵ [[باغاية]] open the gates of this important defensive stronghold of al-ʾAġlabīyūnả [[الأغلبيون]]. In spring 295AH he and his troops can conquer some of the cities and forts along the road from Bāġāyaŧủȵ [[باغاية]] to Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]], namely Maydaraŧủ [[ميدرة]] and al-Ḳaṣraynỉ [[القصرين]], before their expidition is stopped by al-ʾAġlabīyūnả [[الأغلبيون]] at Dārủ Madyanả [[دار مدين]] close to al-Ḳaṣraynỉ [[القصرين]]. In Maydaraŧủ [[ميدرة]] the berbers don’t keep their guarantee of safety and ransack the city and murder its people. Since ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] is ill he can’t stop them. Later al-ʾAġlabīyūnả [[الأغلبيون]] use this incident for their propaganda against al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūnả [[الإسماعيليون]] and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] tries to find the responsible persons among his men, but can’ find them. In winter 296AH ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] advances again eastwards, this time conquering the oases of Šaṭṭủ al-Ǧarīdỉ [[شط الجريد]] in Ḳasṭīliyaŧủȵ [[قسطيلية]], Tūzurủ [[توزر]] and Nafṭaŧủ [[نفطة]], and later Ḳafṣaŧủ [[قفصة]]. A few months later, on 1st Ǧumādá al-ʾAwwalủ [[جمادى الأول]] of 296AH, he has his men move from ʾĪkǧānủ [[إيكجان]] against the city of al-ʾAribusủ [[الأربس]] where ʾIbrāhīmủ bnủ ʾAbī al-ʾAġlabỉ [[إبراهيم بن أبي الأغلب]] awaits him with the ʾaġlabīyủȵ [[أغلبي]] troops. On the 21st Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] he can conquer Šiḳḳaŧủ Banāriyaŧả [[شقة بنارية]] and on the next day he defeats the army of al-ʾamīrủ [[الأمير]] on the plains before al-ʾAribusủ [[الأربس]]. When the news of the defeat arrive at the court of Ziyādaŧủ Allãhỉ [[زيادة الله]], he flees from Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]], and on 1st Raǧabủ [[رجب]] of 296AH ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] moves into Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]]. For al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]] he appoints a governour who is a ʿarabīyủȵ [[عربي]] from Mīlā [[ميلا]], al-Ḥasanủ bnủ ʾAḥmadả bnỉ ʾAbī Ḫinzīrả [[الحسن بن أحمد بن أبي خنزير]]. ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] extends his guarantee of safety first to al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]] and later to all of ʾIfrīḳiyā [[إفريقيا]] which is now under his control. Since al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūnả [[الإسماعيليون]] have now gained enough strength to publicly defend their teachings ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and his brother hold regular public disputations against mālikīyūnả [[مالكيون]], such as ʾIbrāhīmủ bnủ al-Ḫaššābỉ [[إبراهيم بن الخشاب]] and Ibnủ al-Ḥaddādỉ [[ابن الحداد]]. The core of these disputations lies of course in the position of ʿAlīyủȵ [[علي]] and the understanding of the saying of the prophet near the lake Ḫummủȵ [[خم]], where Muḥammadủȵ [[محمد]], according to al-Šīʿīyūnả [[الشيعيون]], designated his nephew as his successor and the one whose commands every muslimủȵ [[مسلم]] has to follow. While his brother wants to purge the city from sunnīyủȵ [[سني]] influences, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] doesn’t give consent. Instead he appoints al-Marwarrūḏīyủ [[المروروذي]] as head judge of al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]] who is ordered to base his rulings on sayings from the descendents of the prophet, al-ʾAʾimmaŧủ [[الأئمة]]. A few months later his authority is established firmly enough that he can head another expedition to Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]]. He appoints ʾAbū Zākỉȵ Tammāmủȵ [[أبو زاك تمام]] as his representative with his brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] as second in command and on 15th Ramaḍānủ [[رمضان]] of 296AH he leaves west. On the way he defeats the berbers of the clan Zinātaŧủȵ [[زناتة]] close to Ṭubnaŧủȵ [[طبنة]] and he puts an end to the rule of al-Yaḳẓānủ [[اليقظان]], al-ʾimāmủ [[الإمام]] of al-ḫāriǧīyūnả [[الخارجيون]], in Tāhirtủ [[تاهرت]] (according to some sources this was in 297AH). On 6th Ḏū al-Ḥiǧǧaŧỉ [[ذو الحجة]] of 296AH he arrives at Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]] and demands from the local ruler al-Yasaʿủ bnủ Midrārả [[اليسع بن مدرار]] the release of al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]]. al-Yasaʿủ bnủ Midrārả [[اليسع بن مدرار]] flees and al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] is instated as the new ruler of al-Maġribủ [[المغرب]]. On 23rd Muḥarramủ [[محرم]] of 297AH al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] heads the army marching eastwards. Both from Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]] as well as from ʾĪkǧānủ [[إيكجان]] where they rest for a few days on their way back, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] sends letters to Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] that are read from the pulpits announcing the arrival of al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]]. A few months later, on 18th Rabīʿủ al-Ṯānī [[ربيع الثاني]], they arrive at Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] and al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] ascends the throne. However, al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]]’s moral conduct astonishes many of the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] berbers and also their teacher himself, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]]. A preamble to an oriental mirror for princes, that only appears in the fāṭimīyủȵ [[فاطمي]] versions and can be attributed to ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]], can be read as a call of caution addressed to al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] not to forget moderation and humility. The first duties that ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to fulfil are military though. On 3rd Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧỉ [[ذو القعدة]] of 297AH he is sent to the West. On 26th the same month he defeats Ibnủ Ḫazarỉȵ [[ابن خزر]] and the Zinātaŧủȵ [[زناتة]] berbers close to Ṭubnaŧủȵ [[طبنة]], he restores order in Tāhirtủ [[تاهرت]], and on 28th Ḏū al-Ḥiǧǧaŧỉ [[ذو الحجة]] of 297AH he arrives at Tanasủ [[تنس]]. In Tanasủ [[تنس]] the leading duʿāŧủȵ [[دعاة]] and the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] chiefs meet conspiratively and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] voices his concern that he might have been mistaken about the identity of the promised mahdīyủȵ [[مهدي]]. They agreed that they would test al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] upon their return. ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] continues with several campaigns against the berber clans Zinātaŧủȵ [[زناتة]] and Ṣadīnaŧủȵ [[صدينة]] and he returns back to Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] only in winter 298AH. His co-conspirators are his brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]], the head šayḫủȵ [[شيخ]] (Šayḫủ al-Mašāyiḫỉ [[شيخ المشايخ]]) from the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]], Hārūnủ bnủ Yūnusả [[هارون بن يونس]], ʾAbū Zākỉȵ Tammāmủȵ [[أبو زاك تمام]] and Ġazwīyaŧủȵ bnủ Yūsufả [[غزوية بن يوسف]]. They confront al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]], but ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] is reluctant to plot al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]]’s death, so he in turn has the time to eliminate his adversaries one by one. Through the help of the traitor Ġazwīyaŧủȵ bnủ Yūsufả [[غزوية بن يوسف]] he makes Hārūnủ bnủ Yūnusả [[هارون بن يونس]] his first victim, then follow ʾAbū Zākỉȵ Tammāmủȵ [[أبو زاك تمام]], ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]]. The two brothers are killed by Ġazwīyaŧủȵ bnủ Yūsufả [[غزوية بن يوسف]] on 15th Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] of 298AH. In fāṭimīyủȵ [[فاطمي]] history he is depicted as the victim of his brother who has supposedly insinuated the thought of treason to ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]]. He writes an autobiography which is probably the main source for al-Nuʿmānủ [[النعمان]]’s Iftitāḥủ al-Daʿwaŧỉ [[افتتاح الدعوة]]. #Halm
