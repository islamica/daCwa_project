BIO: ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] hails from al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U: KUFA_443E320N_S] where he and his by one year older brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] are recruited by a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū ʿAlī [[أبو علي]]. When he was sent to al-Fusṭāṭ [[الفسطاط]] [U: FUSTAT_312E300N_S] in Egypt, ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh [[أبو عبد الله]] and ʾAbū ʿAlī [[أبو علي]] accompany him, with ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh [[أبو عبد الله]] being his envoy to Ibn Ḥawšab [[ابن حوشب]] in al-Yaman [[اليمن]]. In 278AH he leaves Egypt on pilgrimage, and from Makkaŧ [[مكة]] [U:MAKKA_398E213N_S] continues on with yamanī [[يمني]] pilgrims to al-Yaman [[اليمن]]. After nearly a year as a student of Ibn Ḥawšab [[ابن حوشب]], in 279AH, he goes back to Egypt, again via Makkaŧ [[مكة]] [U:MAKKA_398E213N_S]. In Miná [[منى]] [U:MINA_399E213N_S] near Makkaŧ [[مكة]] [U:MAKKA_398E213N_S] he and his companion meet pilgrims from the berber clan Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]] who live close to al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧ [[القسطنطينة]] [U:QUSTANTINIYYA_066E363N_S], some of whom are also šīʿīyūn [[شيعيون]]. They travel together to Egypt and ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] manages to gain their trust. He learns that they live more or less independently from any authority since they live in a remote region, are large in number and well-versed in fighting. They ask ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh [[أبو عبد الله]] to come with them and be a teacher among them and although outwardly reluctant he agrees. Via Ṭarābulus [[طرابلس]] [U:ATRABULUS_131E328N_S] and the oases in Šaṭṭ al-Ǧarīd [[شط الجريد]] the caravan reaches Sūǧmār [[سوجمار]]

 and in early 280AH he enters the Small Kabylia and takes residence in ʾĪkǧān [[إيكجان]] close to Mīlā [[ميلا]] west of al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧ [[القسطنطينة]] where the Banū Saktān [[بنو سكتان]] from the tribe Ǧīmalaŧ [[جيملة]] live. Here he starts holding meetings of wisdom (maǧālis al-ḥikmaŧ [[مجالس الحكمة]]), which he and his brother continue to hold even after Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]] is conquered, and he starts to spread his ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] beliefs; very soon this is the topic of speculation among the surrounding villages. During all this ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has regular contact with ʾAbū ʿAlī [[أبو علي]] in al-Fusṭāṭ [[الفسطاط]] and with the headquarters in Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]]. Very soon the pressure becomes too high and ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to find a new refuge, he finds it with the Banū Ġašmān [[بنو غشمان]] in Tāzrūt [[تازروت]] where he constructs a dār al-hiǧraŧ [[دار الهجرة]]. There he gathers strength for several years, so that when the rulers of the three cities Mīlā [[ميلا]], Saṭīf [[سطيف]] and Bilizmaŧ [[بلزمة]] unite with the not yet converted Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]] his men win the battle. Following this he can convince many more of the berbers of the region to join his cause, the ʾIǧǧānaŧ [[إجانة]], the Laṭāyaŧ [[لطاية]], the Ǧīmalaŧ [[جيملة]], the Malūsaŧ [[ملوسة]], the Danhāǧaŧ [[دنهاجة]], the ʾŪrīsaŧ [[أوريسة]] and the Masāltaŧ [[مسالتة]] who had been ḫāriǧīyūn [[خارجيون]]. ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh [[أبو عبد الله]] divides the Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]] in seven, raises an army from each of these seven groups and appoints a leader for each. He claims no portion in the war loot and promotes asceticism and selfless mutual help. Only after being urged to he takes one of the captured slaves as his wife who carries his son. His reign also includes the application of harsh ḥadd [[حد]] punishments as well as punishments of shunning and exilation according to the degree of the misconduct. In 289AH his men conquer the first city in the region, Mīlā [[ميلا]], however, it is reconquered in the same year in Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧ [[ذو القعدة]] by al-ʾAġlabīyūn [[الأغلبيون]]. They can even drive the ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] troops away from Tāzrūt [[تازروت]] and ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to take up camp in ʾĪkǧān [[إيكجان]] again. In the wake of the murder of the reigning ʾamīr [[أمير]] on 28th Šaʿbān [[شعبان]] of 290AH and the ensuing struggle of his son Ziyādaŧ Allãh [[زيادة الله]] to stabilize his power, ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] can regain Mīlā [[ميلا]] and even seizes control of Saṭīf [[سطيف]] at the end of 291AH. After the city’s governour’s passing away a berber of the tribe Lahīṣaŧ [[لهيصة]] gives the city away. In fall 292AH / 293AH, al-ʾAġlabīyūn [[الأغلبيون]] try another military advance against the Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]] berbers, however they are defeated shortly after leaving al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧ [[القسطنطينة]]. When Saʿīd bn al-Ḥusayn al-Mahdī [[سعيد بن الحسين المهدي]] comes to Siǧilmāsaŧ [[سجلماسة]] in Morocco, ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] regularly exchanges letters with him urging him to come forth, which al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] refuses though. ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] even sends a military expedition of 100 men to Siǧilmāsaŧ [[سجلماسة]], but they don’t come through. In the following years he can expand and conquer Ṭubnaŧ [[طبنة]] and Bilizmaŧ [[بلزمة]]. In Ṭubnaŧ [[طبنة]] he abrogates all forms of taxes that are not grounded in al-Ḳurʾān [[القرآن]]. In Šaʿbān [[شعبان]] of 294AH some of the people of Bāġāyaŧ [[باغاية]] open the gates of this important defensive stronghold of al-ʾAġlabīyūn [[الأغلبيون]]. In spring 295AH he and his troops can conquer some of the cities and forts along the road from Bāġāyaŧ [[باغاية]] to Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]], namely Maydaraŧ [[ميدرة]] and al-Ḳaṣrayn [[القصرين]], before their expidition is stopped by al-ʾAġlabīyūn [[الأغلبيون]] at Dār Madyan [[دار مدين]] close to al-Ḳaṣrayn [[القصرين]]. In Maydaraŧ [[ميدرة]] the berbers don’t keep their guarantee of safety and ransack the city and murder its people. Since ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] is ill he can’t stop them. Later al-ʾAġlabīyūn [[الأغلبيون]] use this incident for their propaganda against al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūn [[الإسماعيليون]] and ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] tries to find the responsible persons among his men, but can’ find them. In winter 296AH ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] advances again eastwards, this time conquering the oases of Šaṭṭ al-Ǧarīd [[شط الجريد]] in Ḳasṭīliyaŧ [[قسطيلية]], Tūzur [[توزر]] and Nafṭaŧ [[نفطة]], and later Ḳafṣaŧ [[قفصة]]. A few months later, on 1st Ǧumādá al-ʾAwwal [[جمادى الأول]] of 296AH, he has his men move from ʾĪkǧān [[إيكجان]] against the city of al-ʾAribus [[الأربس]] where ʾIbrāhīm bn ʾAbī al-ʾAġlab [[إبراهيم بن أبي الأغلب]] awaits him with the ʾaġlabī [[أغلبي]] troops. On the 21st Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] he can conquer Šiḳḳaŧ Banāriyaŧ [[شقة بنارية]] and on the next day he defeats the army of al-ʾamīr [[الأمير]] on the plains before al-ʾAribus [[الأربس]]. When the news of the defeat arrive at the court of Ziyādaŧ Allãh [[زيادة الله]], he flees from Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]], and on 1st Raǧab [[رجب]] of 296AH ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] moves into Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]]. For al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]] he appoints a governour who is a ʿarabī [[عربي]] from Mīlā [[ميلا]], al-Ḥasan bn ʾAḥmad bn ʾAbī Ḫinzīr [[الحسن بن أحمد بن أبي خنزير]]. ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] extends his guarantee of safety first to al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]] and later to all of ʾIfrīḳiyā [[إفريقيا]] which is now under his control. Since al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūn [[الإسماعيليون]] have now gained enough strength to publicly defend their teachings ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and his brother hold regular public disputations against mālikīyūn [[مالكيون]], such as ʾIbrāhīm bn al-Ḫaššāb [[إبراهيم بن الخشاب]] and Ibn al-Ḥaddād [[ابن الحداد]]. The core of these disputations lies of course in the position of ʿAlī [[علي]] and the understanding of the saying of the prophet near the lake Ḫumm [[خم]], where Muḥammad [[محمد]], according to al-Šīʿīyūn [[الشيعيون]], designated his nephew as his successor and the one whose commands every muslim [[مسلم]] has to follow. While his brother wants to purge the city from sunnī [[سني]] influences, ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] doesn’t give consent. Instead he appoints al-Marwarrūḏī [[المروروذي]] as head judge of al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]] who is ordered to base his rulings on sayings from the descendents of the prophet, al-ʾAʾimmaŧ [[الأئمة]]. A few months later his authority is established firmly enough that he can head another expedition to Siǧilmāsaŧ [[سجلماسة]]. He appoints ʾAbū Zākī Tammām [[أبو زاكي تمام]] as his representative with his brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] as second in command and on 15th Ramaḍān [[رمضان]] of 296AH he leaves west. On the way he defeats the berbers of the clan Zinātaŧ [[زناتة]] close to Ṭubnaŧ [[طبنة]] and he puts an end to the rule of al-Yaḳẓān [[اليقظان]], al-ʾimām [[الإمام]] of al-ḫāriǧīyūn [[الخارجيون]], in Tāhirt [[تاهرت]] (according to some sources this was in 297AH). On 6th Ḏū al-Ḥiǧǧaŧ [[ذو الحجة]] of 296AH he arrives at Siǧilmāsaŧ [[سجلماسة]] and demands from the local ruler al-Yasaʿ bn Midrār [[اليسع بن مدرار]] the release of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]]. al-Yasaʿ bn Midrār [[اليسع بن مدرار]] flees and al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] is instated as the new ruler of al-Maġrib [[المغرب]]. On 23rd Muḥarram [[محرم]] of 297AH al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] heads the army marching eastwards. Both from Siǧilmāsaŧ [[سجلماسة]] as well as from ʾĪkǧān [[إيكجان]] where they rest for a few days on their way back, ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] sends letters to Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]] that are read from the pulpits announcing the arrival of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]]. A few months later, on 18th Rabīʿ al-Ṯānī [[ربيع الثاني]], they arrive at Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]] and al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] ascends the throne. However, al-Mahdī [[المهدي]]’s moral conduct astonishes many of the Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]] berbers and also their teacher himself, ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]]. A preamble to an oriental mirror for princes, that only appears in the fāṭimī [[فاطمي]] versions and can be attributed to ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]], can be read as a call of caution addressed to al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] not to forget moderation and humility. The first duties that ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to fulfil are military though. On 3rd Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧ [[ذو القعدة]] of 297AH he is sent to the West. On 26th the same month he defeats Ibn Ḫazar [[ابن خزر]] and the Zinātaŧ [[زناتة]] berbers close to Ṭubnaŧ [[طبنة]], he restores order in Tāhirt [[تاهرت]], and on 28th Ḏū al-Ḥiǧǧaŧ [[ذو الحجة]] of 297AH he arrives at Tanas [[تنس]]. In Tanas [[تنس]] the leading duʿāŧ [[دعاة]] and the Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]] chiefs meet conspiratively and ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] voices his concern that he might have been mistaken about the identity of the promised mahdī [[مهدي]]. They agree that they would test al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] upon their return. ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] continues with several campaigns against the berber clans Zinātaŧ [[زناتة]] and Ṣadīnaŧ [[صدينة]] and he returns back to Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]] only in winter 298AH. His co-conspirators are his brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]], the head šayḫ [[شيخ]] (Šayḫ al-Mašāyiḫ [[شيخ المشايخ]]) from the Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]], Hārūn bn Yūnus [[هارون بن يونس]], ʾAbū Zākī Tammām [[أبو زاكي تمام]] and Ġazwīyaŧ bn Yūsuf [[غزوية بن يوسف]]. They confront al-Mahdī [[المهدي]], but ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] is reluctant to plot al-Mahdī [[المهدي]]’s death, so he in turn has the time to eliminate his adversaries one by one. Through the help of the traitor Ġazwīyaŧ bn Yūsuf [[غزوية بن يوسف]] he makes Hārūn bn Yūnus [[هارون بن يونس]] his first victim, then follow ʾAbū Zākī Tammām [[أبو زاكي تمام]], ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] and ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]]. The two brothers are killed by Ġazwīyaŧ bn Yūsuf [[غزوية بن يوسف]] on 15th Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] of 298AH. In fāṭimī [[فاطمي]] history he is depicted as the victim of his brother who has supposedly insinuated the thought of treason to ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]]. He writes an autobiography which is probably the main source for al-Nuʿmān [[النعمان]]’s Iftitāḥ al-Daʿwaŧ [[افتتاح الدعوة]]. [@halm_reich_1991]
