BIO: ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] hails from al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]] where he and his by one year older brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] are recruited by a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]]. When he was sent to al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] in Egypt, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] and ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] accompany him, with ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] being his envoy to Ibnủ Ḥawšabỉȵ [[ابن حوشب]] in al-Yamanủ [[اليمن]]. In 278AH he leaves Egypt on pilgrimage, and from al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]] continues on with yamanīyủȵ [[يمني]] pilgrims to al-Yamanủ [[اليمن]]. After nearly a year as a student of Ibnủ Ḥawšabỉȵ [[ابن حوشب]], in 279AH, he goes back to Egypt, again via al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]]. In Miná [[منى]] near al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]] he and his companion meet pilgrims from the berber clan Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] close to al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧủ [[القسطنطينة]], some of whom are also šīʿīyūnả [[شيعيون]]. They travel together to Egypt and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] manages to gain their trust. He learns that they live more or less independent from any authority since they live in a remote region, are large in number and well-versed in fighting. They ask ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] to come with them and be a teacher among them and although outwardly reluctant he agrees. Via Ṭarābulusủ [[طرابلس]] and the oases in Šaṭṭủ al-Ǧarīdỉ [[شط الجريد]] the caravan reaches Sūǧmārủ [[سوجمار]] and in early 280AH he enters the Small Kabylia and takes residence in ʾĪkǧānủ [[إيكجان]] close to Mīlā [[ميلا]] west of al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧủ [[القسطنطينة]] where the Banū Saktānỉȵ [[بنو سكتان]] from the tribe Ǧīmalaŧủȵ [[جيملة]] live. Here he starts holding meetings of wisdom (maǧālisủ al-ḥikmaŧỉ [[مجالس الحكمة]]), which he and his brother continue to hold even after Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] is conquered, and he starts to spread his ʾismāʿīlīyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] beliefs; very soon this is the topic of speculation among the surrounding villages. During all this ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] has regular contact with ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] in al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] and with the headquarters in Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]]. Very soon the pressure becomes to high and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to find a new refuge, he finds it with the Banū Ġašmānỉȵ [[بنو غشمان]] in Tāzrūtủ [[تازروت]] where he constructs a dārủ al-hiǧraŧỉ [[دار الهجرة]]. There he gathered strength for several years, so that when the rulers of the three cities Mīlā [[ميلا]], Saṭīfủȵ [[سطيف]] and Bilizmaŧủȵ [[بلزمة]] unite with the not yet converted Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] his men win the battle. Following this he can convince many more of the berbers of the region to join his cause, the ʾIǧǧānaŧủȵ [[إجانة]], the Laṭāyaŧủȵ [[لطاية]], the Ǧīmalaŧủȵ [[جيملة]], the Malūsaŧủȵ [[ملوسة]], the Danhāǧaŧủȵ [[دنهاجة]], the ʾŪrīsaŧủȵ [[أوريسة]] and the Masāltaŧủȵ [[مسالتة]] who had been ḫāriǧīyūnả [[خارجيون]]. ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] divides the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] in seven, raises an army from each of these seven groups and appoints a leader for each. He claims no portion in the war loot and promotes asceticism and selfless mutual help. Only after being urged to he takes one of the captured slaves as his wife who carries his son. His reign also includes the application of harsh ḥaddủȵ [[حد]] punishments as well as punishments of shunning and exilation according to the degree of the misconduct. In 289AH his men conquer the first city in the region, Mīlā [[ميلا]]. When al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] comes to Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]] in Morocco, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] regularly exchanges letters with him urging him to come forth, which al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] refuses though. In 293AH or 294AH he conquers Ṭubnaŧủȵ [[طبنة]]. In 297AH when he is on his way to al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] in Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]] he puts an end to the rule of al-ʾimāmủ [[الإمام]] of al-ḫāriǧīyūnả [[الخارجيون]] in Tāzirtủ [[تازرت]]. When al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūnả [[الإسماعيليون]] have gained enough strength to publicly defend their teachings ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] hold regular public disputations against mālikīyūnả [[مالكيون]], such as ʾIbrāhīmủ bnủ al-Ḫaššābỉ [[إبراهيم بن الخشاب]] and Ibnủ al-Ḥaddādỉ [[ابن الحداد]]. The core of these disputations lies of course in the position of ʿAlīyủȵ [[علي]] and the understanding of the saying of the prophet near the lake Ḫummủȵ [[خم]], where Muḥammadủȵ [[محمد]], according to al-Šīʿīyūnả [[الشيعيون]], designated his nephew as his successor and the one whose commands every muslimủȵ [[مسلم]] has to follow. He writes an autobiography. In 298AH he and his brother are dispensed of.
