BIO: Zakarūyaŧ bn Mihrūyaŧ [[زكروية بن مهروية]] is the son of one of ʿAbdān [[عبدان]]’s first missionaries in al-Sawād [[السواد]] and comes from the village al-Maysānīyaŧ [[الميسانية]] close to al-Ṣawʾar [[الصوءر]], four miles west of al-Ḳādisīyaŧ [[القادسية]] [U:QADISIYYA_441E316N_S]. He himself is appointed as dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] in this district, al-Ṣaylaḥīn [[الصيلحين]], and advances al-daʿwaŧ [[الدعوة]] among the tribe Kulayb [[كليب]] west of al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S]. After the split in 286AH between ʿAbdān [[عبدان]] and the new al-Ḥuǧǧaŧ [[الحجة]] in Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S], Saʿīd bn al-Ḥusayn al-Mahdī [[سعيد بن الحسين المهدي]], he is visited by an envoy from Saʿīd bn al-Ḥusayn [[سعيد بن الحسين]], probably a brother of his, who successfully pulls him over to his side when he promises him that he will be the next head of the ʿirāḳī [[عراقي]] cell. Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]] begins plotting ʿAbdān [[عبدان]]’s murder and has some of his followers from the clan Tamīm [[تميم]] of the tribe Kulayb [[كليب]] kill ʿAbdān [[عبدان]]. His involvement is apparent and he has to hide for a year in the house of a family member. In 287AH he appears again and agitates among the clans of ʾAsad [[أسد]], Ṭayyiʾ [[طيء]] and Tamīm [[تميم]], but he fails to convince them that the other al-Ḳarmaṭīyūn [[القرمطيون]] would unite with them after they follow him. In 288AH he turns to bedouins further west of al-Furāt [[الفرات]] [U:NAHRFURAT_412E344N_W] and sends two of his sons, al-Ḥusayn [[الحسين]] and Yaḥyá [[يحيى]], to the tribe al-Kalb [[الكلب]] in the desert of al-Samāwaŧ [[السماوة]]. The clan Banū al-ʿUllayṣ [[بنو العليص]] and their clients as well as parts of the clan Banū al-ʾAṣbaġ [[بنو الأصبغ]] join the followers of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] in Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S]. In 289AH the envoy mentioned above, the assumed brother of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]], visits Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]] in his hiding place in al-ʿIrāḳ [[العراق]], who sends him, together with his nephew and one of his slaves, to his son al-Ḥusayn [[الحسين]] with the Banū al-ʿUllayṣ [[بنو العليص]]. When his sons are militarilly defeated, Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]] sends a letter to the Banū al-ʿUllayṣ [[بنو العليص]], saying that after the death of their leaders the time has come now for the true al-ʾimām [[الإمام]], namely al-Mahdī [[المهدي]], to come forth victorious. However, Ibn Sīmā [[ابن سيما]], the governor of al-Raḥbaŧ [[الرحبة]] [U:RAHBAMALIKIBNTAWQ_404E349N_S], preemptively attacks the Banū al-ʿUllayṣ [[بنو العليص]] in Ramaḍān [[رمضان]] of 291AH. In early 293AH he sends one of his missionaries, ʾAbū Ġānim Naṣr [[أبو غانم نصر]], to the Palmyrene region, who again rallies his supporters and raids several cities before he is killed by unhappy followers. Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]]’s last envoy to that region is al-Ḳāsim bn ʾAḥmad [[القاسم بن أحمد]] who promises the appearance of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] and who can again gather some 800 men to raid al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S] on the ʿĪd al-ʾAḍḥá [[عيد الأضحى]] of 293AH. When they retreat to al-Ṣawʾar [[الصوءر]], close to Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]]’s hiding place in al-Daryaŧ [[الدرية]], west of al-Ḳādisīyaŧ [[القادسية]] [U:QADISIYYA_441E316N_S], he finally reveals himself and has al-Ḳāsim [[القاسم]] lead them to the edge of the area that is watered by the Euphrates near al-Ṣawʾar [[الصوءر]]. There the government troops catch up with them on 20th or 21st of Ḏū al-Ḥiǧǧaŧ [[ذو الحجة]] but are defeated by Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]]’s men. Encouraged by this victory they target the pilgrims’ caravan coming back from pilgrimage in Makkaŧ [[مكة]] [U:MAKKA_398E213N_S]. On 13th or 14th of Muḥarram [[محرم]] in 294AH they encounter the second of three caravans at the standpipe of al-ʿAḳabaŧ [[العقبة]] [U:AQABA_436E300N_S]. After some resistence they beat the small escort and loot the riches they can find. The news from this defeat quickly reaches Baġdād [[بغداد]] [U:BAGHDAD_443E333N_S] and the government sends another army to save the third caravan. The two armies meet on 22nd Rabīʿ al-ʾAwwal [[ربيع الأول]] of 294AH in Wādī Ḏī Ḳār [[وادي ذي قار]] and within the next two days the bedouins are slaughtered and Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]] is slain. His corpse is conserved, brought to Baġdād [[بغداد]] [U:BAGHDAD_443E333N_S] and shown to the public. Still for some time rumours are heard in the villages of al-Sawād [[السواد]] that Zakarūyaŧ [[زكروية]] wasn’t dead but would soon reappear. [@halm_reich_1991]
