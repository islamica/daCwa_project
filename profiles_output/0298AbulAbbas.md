BIO: He and his by one year younger brother, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]], are converted in al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]] by a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]]. When ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] moves to Egypt, he joins him and is his envoy between al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] and Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]]. When in 289AH Saʿīdủȵ bnủ al-Ḥusaynỉ al-Mahdīyủ [[سعيد بن الحسين المهدي]] has to flee from Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] he is one of his close followers that accompany him. They stay in al-Ramlaŧủ [[الرملة]] from 22nd Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧỉ [[ذو القعدة]] of 289AH until early 291AH, when they continue to al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] after the capture of al-Ḥusaynủ bnủ Zakarūyaŧỉȵ [[الحسين بن زكروية]]. There they can stay for about another year with Ibnủ ʿAyyāšỉȵ [[ابن عياش]] a disciple of ʾAbū ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أبو علي]]. In spring 292AH they continue on towards al-Maġribủ [[المغرب]]. On the way, close to al-Ṭāḥūnaŧủ [[الطاحونة]], halfway between al-ʾIskandarīyaŧủ [[الإسكندرية]] and Cyrenaica, they encounter berber tribes who rob them. In the fight ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]]’ face is wounded by a sword. The group stay for a while in Ṭarābulusủ [[طرابلس]] to wait for one of al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]]’s slaves who was sent back to Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] to bring the treasures that were left behind. ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] is sent ahead to al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]] though. However, the information about al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] and his followers travelling west made it already to al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]] and ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] is recognized and arrested upon entering the city in summer 292AH. Even under torture he repeats the claim that he was just a normal merchant, so his life is spared, and about one year later, on 11th Ǧumādá al-ʾAwwalủ [[جمادى الأول]] of 293AH he is freed by rebelling troops who were rallied in order to defeat ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and the tribes of Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]]. After some time in hiding in al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]] he can flee to Ṭarābulusủ [[طرابلس]] where al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] had left his mother in the care of al-dāʿī [[الداعي]] with the name ʾAbū Ǧaʿfarỉȵ al-Ḫazarīyủ [[أبو جعفر الخزري]]. He contacts him, entering into a public dispute with him in order not to arouse suspicion. After al-ʾamīrủ [[الأمير]] of al-ʾAġlabīyūnả [[الأغلبيون]], Ziyādaŧủ Allãhỉ [[زيادة الله]], flees from Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] on 23rd Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] of 296AH, he passes by Ṭarābulusủ [[طرابلس]]. There he has ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] arrested and tortured again, but again he can’t break him and he has to let him go. ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] then leaves to Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] and reunites with his brother ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] who took reign of ʾIfrīḳiyā [[إفريقيا]] in the name of al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]]. Together they hold regular public disputations in al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]] against mālikīyūnả [[مالكيون]], such as ʾIbrāhīmủ bnủ al-Ḫaššābỉ [[إبراهيم بن الخشاب]] and Ibnủ al-Ḥaddādỉ [[ابن الحداد]]. The core of these disputations lies of course in the position of ʿAlīyủȵ [[علي]] and the understanding of the saying of the prophet near the lake Ḫummủȵ [[خم]], where Muḥammadủȵ [[محمد]], according to al-Šīʿīyūnả [[الشيعيون]], designated his nephew as his successor and the one whose commands every muslimủȵ [[مسلم]] has to follow. He wants to purge the city from sunnīyủȵ [[سني]] influences, but doesn’t receive his brother’s consent. When on 15th Ramaḍānủ [[رمضان]] of 296AH ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] leaves with a large number of troops to Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]] in order to bring al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] to Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]] he leaves the control of his empire to ʾAbū Zākỉȵ Tammāmủȵ bnủ Muʿārikỉȵ [[أبو زاك تمام بن معارك]] and appoints ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] as his second in command. Without ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and his troops from the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] they face open opposition within a week, even from al-Marwarrūḏīyủ [[المروروذي]] whom ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] had appointed as head judge of al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]]. ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] is asked to hold an audience to dispel the rumours about the fate of his brother and his troops. He receives his guests with utmost hospitality and promises them many blessings in this world and the next should they follow his commands. Then he starts to openly attract followers to his creed. Al-Marwarrūḏīyủ [[المروروذي]] is ordered to base his rulings on sayings from the descendents of the prophet, al-ʾAʾimmaŧủ [[الأئمة]]. Mālikủȵ [[مالك]] and ʾAbū Ḥanīfaŧỉȵ [[أبو حنيفة]] are not to be referenced any more at court. In Ṣafarủȵ [[صفر]] of 297AH he has two ʿulamāʾủ [[علماء]] arrested and executed after they had allegedly equalled the three first ḫulafāʾủ [[خلفاء]], ʾAbū Bakrỉȵ [[أبو بكر]], ʿUmarủ [[عمر]] and ʿUṯmānủ [[عثمان]], with ʿAlīyủȵ bnủ ʾAbī Ṭālibỉȵ [[علي بن أبي طالب]]. In winter 297AH al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] finally approaches Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]], and even before he reaches his capital he is greeted by ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] and a number of his devoted followers in Sabībaŧủȵ [[سبيبة]] some 90 km away from al-Ḳayrawānủ [[القيروان]]. However, he doesn’t take up his ensuing reign the way that some of his followers had expected. Especially ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] are disappointed by his lack of detachment from material possessions and his endulgement in egoistic pleasures. Together with Hārūnủ bnủ Yūnusả [[هارون بن يونس]], ʾAbū Zākỉȵ Tammāmủȵ [[أبو زاك تمام]] and Ġazwīyaŧủȵ bnủ Yūsufả [[غزوية بن يوسف]] they confront al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] in winter 298AH. When he has Hārūnủ bnủ Yūnusả [[هارون بن يونس]] eliminated the group discuss overthrowing al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]], but mainly ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿīyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] is reluctant. After they are betrayed by Ġazwīyaŧủȵ bnủ Yūsufả [[غزوية بن يوسف]], al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] has the rest killed on 15th Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] of 298AH, including ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] in Raḳḳādaŧủ [[رقادة]]. According to fāṭimīyủȵ [[فاطمي]] propaganda he is the one who has had the bad influence on his brother. #Halm
