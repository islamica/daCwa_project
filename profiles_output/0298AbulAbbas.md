BIO: He and his by one year younger brother, ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]], are converted in al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] by a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū ʿAlī [[أبو علي]]. When ʾAbū ʿAlī [[أبو علي]] moves to Egypt, he joins him and is his envoy between al-Fusṭāṭ [[الفسطاط]] and Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]]. When in 289AH Saʿīd bn al-Ḥusayn al-Mahdī [[سعيد بن الحسين المهدي]] has to flee from Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] he is one of his close followers that accompany him. They stay in al-Ramlaŧ [[الرملة]] from 22nd Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧ [[ذو القعدة]] of 289AH until early 291AH, when they continue to al-Fusṭāṭ [[الفسطاط]] after the capture of al-Ḥusayn bn Zakarūyaŧ [[الحسين بن زكروية]]. There they can stay for about another year with Ibn ʿAyyāš [[ابن عياش]], a disciple of ʾAbū ʿAlī [[أبو علي]]. In spring 292AH they continue on towards al-Maġrib [[المغرب]]. On the way, close to al-Ṭāḥūnaŧ [[الطاحونة]], halfway between al-ʾIskandarīyaŧ [[الإسكندرية]] and Cyrenaica, they encounter berber tribes who rob them. In the fight ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]]’ face is wounded by a sword. The group stay for a while in Ṭarābulus [[طرابلس]] to wait for one of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]]’s slaves who was sent back to Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] to bring the treasures that were left behind. ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] is sent ahead to al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]] though. However, the information about al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] and his followers travelling west made it already to al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]] and ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] is recognized and arrested upon entering the city in summer 292AH. Even under torture he repeats the claim that he was just a normal merchant, so his life is spared, and about one year later, on 11th Ǧumādá al-ʾAwwal [[جمادى الأول]] of 293AH he is freed by rebelling troops who were rallied in order to defeat ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and the tribes of Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]]. After some time in hiding in al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]] he can flee to Ṭarābulus [[طرابلس]] where al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] had left his mother in the care of a dāʿiȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū Ǧaʿfar al-Ḫazarī [[أبو جعفر الخزري]]. He contacts him, entering into a public dispute with him in order not to arouse suspicion. After al-ʾamīr [[الأمير]] of al-ʾAġlabīyūn [[الأغلبيون]], Ziyādaŧ Allãh [[زيادة الله]], flees from Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]] on 23rd Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] of 296AH, he passes by Ṭarābulus [[طرابلس]]. There he has ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] arrested and tortured again, but again he can’t break him and he has to let him go. ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] then leaves to Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]] and reunites with his brother ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] who took reign of ʾIfrīḳiyā [[إفريقيا]] in the name of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]]. Together they hold regular public disputations in al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]] against mālikīyūn [[مالكيون]], such as ʾIbrāhīm bn al-Ḫaššāb [[إبراهيم بن الخشاب]] and Ibn al-Ḥaddād [[ابن الحداد]]. The core of these disputations lies of course in the position of ʿAlī [[علي]] and the understanding of the saying of the prophet near the lake Ḫumm [[خم]], where Muḥammad [[محمد]], according to al-Šīʿīyūn [[الشيعيون]], designated his nephew as his successor and the one whose commands every muslim [[مسلم]] has to follow. He wants to purge the city from sunnī [[سني]] influences, but doesn’t receive his brother’s consent. When on 15th Ramaḍān [[رمضان]] of 296AH ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] leaves with a large number of troops to Siǧilmāsaŧ [[سجلماسة]] in order to bring al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] to Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]] he leaves the control of his empire to ʾAbū Zākī Tammām bn Muʿārik [[أبو زاكي تمام بن معارك]] and appoints ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] as his second in command. Without ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and his troops from the Kutāmaŧ [[كتامة]] they face open opposition within a week, even from al-Marwarrūḏī [[المروروذي]] whom ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] had appointed as head judge of al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]]. ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] is asked to hold an audience to dispel the rumours about the fate of his brother and his troops. He receives his guests with utmost hospitality and promises them many blessings in this world and the next should they follow his commands. Then he starts to openly attract followers to his creed. Al-Marwarrūḏī [[المروروذي]] is ordered to base his rulings on sayings from the descendents of the prophet, al-ʾAʾimmaŧ [[الأئمة]]. Mālik [[مالك]] and ʾAbū Ḥanīfaŧ [[أبو حنيفة]] are not to be referenced any more at court. In Ṣafar [[صفر]] of 297AH he has two ʿulamāʾ [[علماء]] arrested and executed after they had allegedly equalled the three first ḫulafāʾ [[خلفاء]], ʾAbū Bakr [[أبو بكر]], ʿUmar [[عمر]] and ʿUṯmān [[عثمان]], with ʿAlī bn ʾAbī Ṭālib [[علي بن أبي طالب]]. In winter 297AH al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] finally approaches Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]], and even before he reaches his capital he is greeted by ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] and a number of his devoted followers in Sabībaŧ [[سبيبة]] some 90 km away from al-Ḳayrawān [[القيروان]]. However, he doesn’t take up his ensuing reign the way that some of his followers had expected. Especially ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] and ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] are disappointed by his lack of detachment from material possessions and his endulgement in egoistic pleasures. Together with Hārūn bn Yūnus [[هارون بن يونس]], ʾAbū Zākī Tammām [[أبو زاكي تمام]] and Ġazwīyaŧ bn Yūsuf [[غزوية بن يوسف]] they confront al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] in winter 298AH. When he has Hārūn bn Yūnus [[هارون بن يونس]] eliminated the group discuss overthrowing al-Mahdī [[المهدي]], but mainly ʾAbū ʿAbd Allãh al-Šīʿī [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] is reluctant. After they are betrayed by Ġazwīyaŧ bn Yūsuf [[غزوية بن يوسف]], al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] has the rest killed on 15th Ǧumādá al-Ṯānī [[جمادى الثاني]] of 298AH, including ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās [[أبو العباس]] in Raḳḳādaŧ [[رقادة]]. According to fāṭimī [[فاطمي]] propaganda he is the one who has had the bad influence on his brother. [@halm_reich_1991]
