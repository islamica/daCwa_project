BIO: ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿiyyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] hails from al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]] where he and his by one year older brother ʾAbū al-ʿAbbāsỉ [[أبو العباس]] are recruited by a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū ʿAliyyỉȵ [[أبو علي]]. When he was sent to al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] in Egypt, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] and ʾAbū ʿAliyyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] accompany him, with ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] being his envoy to Ibnủ Ḥawšabỉȵ [[ابن حوشب]] in al-Yamanủ [[اليمن]]. In 278AH he leaves Egypt on pilgrimage, and from al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]] continues on with yamaniyyủȵ [[يمني]] pilgrims to al-Yamanủ [[اليمن]]. After nearly a year as a student of Ibnủ Ḥawšabỉȵ [[ابن حوشب]], in 279AH, he goes back to Egypt, again via al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]]. In Miná [[منى]] near al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]] he and his companion meet pilgrims from the berber clan Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] close to al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧủ [[القسطنطينة]], some of whom are also šīʿiyyūnả [[شيعيون]]. They travel together to Egypt and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿiyyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] manages to gain their trust. He learns that they live more or less independent from any authority since they live in a remote region, are large in number and well-versed in fighting. They ask ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] to come with them and be a teacher among them and although outwardly reluctant he agrees. Via Ṭarābulusủ [[طرابلس]] and the oases in Šaṭṭủ al-Ǧarīdỉ [[شط الجريد]] the caravan reaches Sūǧmārủ [[سوجمار]] and in early 280AH he enters the Small Kabylia and takes residence in ʾĪkǧānủ [[إيكجان]] close to Mīlā [[ميلا]] west of al-Ḳusṭanṭīnaŧủ [[القسطنطينة]] where the Banū Saktānỉȵ [[بنو سكتان]] from the tribe Ǧīmalaŧủȵ [[جيملة]] live. From there he starts to spread his ʾismāʿīliyyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] beliefs, and very soon this is the topic of speculation among the surrounding villages. During all this ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] has regular contact with ʾAbū ʿAliyyỉȵ [[أبو علي]] in al-Fusṭāṭủ [[الفسطاط]] and with the headquarters in Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]]. Very soon the pressure becomes to high and ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿiyyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] has to find a new refuge, he finds it with the Banū Ġašmānỉȵ [[بنو غشمان]] in Tāzrūtủ [[تازروت]] where he constructs a dārủ al-hiǧraŧỉ [[دار الهجرة]]. There he gathered strength for several years, so that when the rulers of the three cities Mīlā [[ميلا]], Saṭīfủȵ [[سطيف]] and Bilizmaŧủȵ [[بلزمة]] unite with the not yet converted Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] his men win the battle. Following this he can convince many more of the berbers of the region to join his cause, the ʾIǧǧānaŧủȵ [[إجانة]], the Laṭāyaŧủȵ [[لطاية]], the Ǧīmalaŧủȵ [[جيملة]], the Malūsaŧủȵ [[ملوسة]], the Danhāǧaŧủȵ [[دنهاجة]], the ʾŪrīsaŧủȵ [[أوريسة]] and the Masāltaŧủȵ [[مسالتة]] who had been ḫāriǧiyyūnả [[خارجيون]]. ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ [[أبو عبد الله]] divides the Kutāmaŧủȵ [[كتامة]] in seven, raises an army from each of these seven groups and appoints a leader for each. He claims no portion in the war loot promotes asceticism and selfless mutual help. Only after being urged to he takes one of the captured slaves as his wife.
until in 289AH his men conquer the first city in the region, Mīlā [[ميلا]]. When al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]] comes to Siǧilmāsaŧủȵ [[سجلماسة]] in Morocco, ʾAbū ʿAbdỉ Allãhỉ al-Šīʿiyyủ [[أبو عبد الله الشيعي]] regularly exchanges letters with him urging him to come forth, which al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]] refuses though.
