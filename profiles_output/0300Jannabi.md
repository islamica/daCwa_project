BIO: al-Ǧannābī [[الجنابي]] is the founder of the communities in the Gulf region. He is of Persian descent and originally comes from Ǧannābaŧ [[جنابة]]. After he marries into a converted family in al-Sawād [[السواد]] either Ḥamdān Ḳarmaṭ [[حمدان قرمط]] or ʿAbdān [[عبدان]] makes him a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]]. He goes back to his homeland and carries al-daʿwaŧ [[الدعوة]] to Ǧannābaŧ [[جنابة]], Sīnīz [[سينيز]], Ṭawwaǧ [[طوج]] and Mahrūbān [[مهروبان]] as well as in the coast area of al-Fārs [[الفارس]]. He collects taxes from converts, but soon opposition arises. He has to flee and meets up with Ḳarmaṭ [[قرمط]] who believes in his abilities and sends him with new support to al-Baḥrayn [[البحرين]]. In 286AH he settles in al-Ḳaṭīf [[القطيف]] and works as a flour merchant. His first followers are three brothers with the name of ʿAlīy [[علي]], Ḥamdān [[حمدان]] and al-Ḥasan bn Sanbar [[الحسن بن سنبر]] and their families. Very soon he starts converting the bedouins outside the city and incites them to raids against the unbelievers. The first clan that joins al-Ǧannābī [[الجنابي]] are the Banū al-ʾAḍbaṭ [[بنو الأضبط]] from the tribe Kilāb [[كلاب]], a tribe that was cast out by the other tribes, following the promise of being in the first rank of the coming kingdom of God. In 286AH al-Ǧannābī [[الجنابي]]’s men occupy al-Ḳaṭīf [[القطيف]], in 287AH they are spotted close to al-Baṣraŧ [[البصرة]], their main interest is the oasis of Haǧar [[هجر]] though on which they lay siege. In the close town of al-ʾAḥsāʾ [[الأحساء]] he constructs a dār al-hiǧraŧ [[دار الهجرة]] for the region, from where al-Ǧannābīy [[الجنابي]] reigns like a prince. When the siege of Haǧar [[هجر]] is still under way the alarmed caliph al-Muʿtaḍid [[المعتضد]] has 2,000 men sent from al-Baṣraŧ [[البصرة]] to the oases of al-Baḥrayn [[البحرين]] to regain control. However, at the end of Raǧab [[رجب]] in 287AH they are defeated by al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūn [[الإسماعيليون]]. al-Ǧannābī [[الجنابي]] has the allegedly 700 captives killed except for the commanding officer who is sent back to the caliph to Baġdād [[بغداد]]. Later in the same year Haǧar [[هجر]] is taken and destroyed, and whoever decides not to convert has to flee. When the schism between the headquarters in Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] and al-Ḳarmaṭīyūn [[القرمطيون]] happens, al-Ǧannābī [[الجنابي]] and his ǧazīraŧ [[جزيرة]] follow his mentors in al-Sawād [[السواد]]; he has his opponent ʾAbū Zakarīyāʾ al-Ḍammāmī [[أبو زكرياء الضمامي]], a loyalist to al-Fāṭimīyūn [[الفاطميون]] killed. At the end of 299AH there is a raid on al-sūḳ [[السوق]] of al-Baṣraŧ [[البصرة]]. In Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧ [[ذو القعدة]] of 300AH al-Ǧannābī [[الجنابي]] is murdered by one of his slaves, maybe as a result of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] not appearing when al-Ǧannābī [[الجنابي]] had prophesied so. One of his six sons follows as his succesor. [@halm_reich_1991]
