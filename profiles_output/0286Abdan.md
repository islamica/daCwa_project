BIO: He is the brother-in-law of Ḥamdān Ḳarmaṭ [[حمدان قرمط]] (NOURI) and like him comes from Ḳuss Bahrām [[قس بهرام]] close to Bābil [[بابل]] [U:BABIL_444E325N_S]. They are converted together by al-Ḥusayn al-ʾAhwāzī [[الحسين الأهوازي]] (NOURI) either in 261AH or 264AH. Following this they head the mission in al-Sawād [[السواد]], around al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S], with ʿAbdān [[عبدان]] focussing on the rural areas. From his converts he appoints a head dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] for each district that each have a number of duʿāŧ [[دعاة]]. Among the bedouins he is likewise successful, the majority of them join al-daʿwaŧ [[الدعوة]]. From the converts he and his brother-in-law collect taxes in the name of the promised al-Mahdī [[المهدي]], that are either sent to Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S] or saved locally, they enjoin on their followers the principle of al-ʾulfaŧ [[الألفة]], meaning that everyone has to share their material belongings with all the other believers, and from 276AH they command them to buy and secretly store weapons. During all this ʿAbdān [[عبدان]] is in close contact with al-Ḥuǧǧaŧ [[الحجة]] ʾAbū al-Šalaġlaġ [[أبو الشلغلغ]] (NOURI) in Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S] via carrier pigeons. In the year 277AH or 279AH he begins to fortify a dār al-hiǧraŧ [[دار الهجرة]] in the village Mahtamābād [[مهتماباد]] in the province al-Furāt [[الفرات]] close to al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S]. Only during summer 284AH the gouvernor of al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S] starts to approach the ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] villages in al-Sawād [[السواد]], the region around al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S], militarilly and sends some of the arrested ʾIsmāʿīlīyaŧ [[إسماعيلية]] to Baġdād [[بغداد]] [U:BAGHDAD_443E333N_S]. From the interrogations it becomes apparent that the connections of Ḥamdān Ḳarmaṭ [[حمدان قرمط]] (NOURI) and ʿAbdān [[عبدان]] even reached officials in Baġdād [[بغداد]] [U:BAGHDAD_443E333N_S]. When ʾAbū al-Šalaġlaġ [[أبو الشلغلغ]] (NOURI) passes away in 286AH, his brother-in-law becomes suspicious of the true intentions of Saʿīd bn al-Ḥusayn [[سعيد بن الحسين]] (NOURI), his successor as al-Ḥuǧǧaŧ [[الحجة]], and sends ʿAbdān [[عبدان]] to the headquarters in Salamīyaŧủ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S]. After it becomes clear to him that Saʿīd bn? al-Ḥusayn [[سعيد بن? الحسين]] (NOURI) isn’t advancing the cause of the hidden al-ʾImām [[الإمام]] Muḥammad bn ʾIsmāʿīl [[محمد بن إسماعيل]] (NOURI) but considers himself as the true al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] he and his brother-in-law instruct all al-duʿāŧ [[الدعاة]] in al-Sawād [[السواد]], the region around al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S], to suspend al-daʿwaŧ [[الدعوة]] and the schism of al-Ḳarāmiṭaŧ [[القرامطة]] ensues. He is later visited by an envoy from Saʿīd bn al-Ḥusayn [[سعيد بن الحسين]] (NOURI), probably a brother of his, who tries to win back his loyalty. When he doesn’t succeed he incites Zakarūyaŧ bn Mihrūyaŧ [[زكروية بن مهروية]] [U:0294Zakaroye], a son of one of ʿAbdān [[عبدان]]’s first followers, to plotting his murder. This plot succeeds and followers of Zakarūyaŧ bn Mihrūyaŧ [[زكروية بن مهروية]] [U:0294Zakaroye] from the clan Tamīm [[تميم]] of the tribe Kulayb [[كليب]] who live west of al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S] kill him during a night in his home in the village Nāsūrā [[ناسورا]]. At least until 315AH his followers still act in the name of the hidden al-ʾImām [[الإمام]] Muḥammad bn ʾIsmāʿīl [[محمد بن إسماعيل]] (NOURI), have scriptures with his alleged authorship circulate and believe that he is still alive. [@halm_reich_1991] Among the later composed books ascribed to him are the Book of the Brilliant Truth, the Book of the clear Truth, and the Book of “In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful”.
