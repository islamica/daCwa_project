BIO: Zakarūyaŧủȵ bnủ Mihrūyaŧỉȵ [[زكروية بن مهروية]] is the son of one of ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]]’s first missionaries in al-Sawādủ [[السواد]] and comes from the village al-Maysāniyyaŧủ [[الميسانية]] close to al-Ṣawʾarủ [[الصوءر]], four miles west of al-Ḳādisiyyaŧủ [[القادسية]]. He himself is appointed as dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] in this district, al-Ṣaylaḥīnả [[الصيلحين]], and advances al-daʿwaŧủ [[الدعوة]] among the tribe Kulaybủȵ [[كليب]] west of al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]]. After the split in 286AH between ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]] and the new al-Ḥuǧǧaŧủ [[الحجة]] in Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]], Saʿīdủȵ bnủ al-Ḥusaynỉ al-Mahdiyyủ [[سعيد بن الحسين المهدي]], he is visited by an envoy from Saʿīdủȵ bnủ al-Ḥusaynỉ [[سعيد بن الحسين]], probably a brother of his, who successfully pulls him over to his side when he promises him that he will be the next head of the ʿirāḳiyyủȵ [[عراقي]] cell. Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]] begins plotting ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]]’s murder and has some of his followers from the clan Tamīmủȵ [[تميم]] of the tribe Kulaybủȵ [[كليب]] kill ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]]. His involvement is apparent and he has to hide for a year in the house of a family member. In 287AH he appears again and agitates among the clans of ʾAsadủȵ [[أسد]], Ṭayyiʾủȵ [[طيئ]] and Tamīmủȵ [[تميم]], but he fails to convince them that the other al-Ḳarmaṭiyyūnả [[القرمطيون]] would unite with them after they follow him. In 288AH he turns to bedouins further west of al-Furātủ [[الفرات]] and sends two of his sons, al-Ḥusaynủ [[الحسين]] and Yaḥyá [[يحيى]], to the tribe al-Kalbủ [[الكلب]] in the desert of al-Samāwaŧủ [[السماوة]]. The clan Banū al-ʿUllayṣỉ [[بنو العليص]] and their clients as well as parts of the clan Banū al-ʾAṣbaġỉ [[بنو الأصبغ]] join the followers of al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]] in Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]]. In 289AH the envoy mentioned above, the assumed brother of al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]], visits Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]] in his hiding place in al-ʿIrāḳủ [[العراق]], who sends him, together with his nephew and one of his slaves, to his son al-Ḥusaynủ [[الحسين]] with the Banū al-ʿUllayṣỉ [[بنو العليص]]. When his sons are militarilly defeated, Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]] sends a letter to the Banū al-ʿUllayṣỉ [[بنو العليص]], saying that after the death of their leaders the time has come now for the true al-ʾimāmủ [[الإمام]], namely al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]], to come forth victorious. However, Ibnủ Sīmā [[ابن سيما]], the governor of al-Raḥbaŧủ [[الرحبة]], preemptively attacks the Banū al-ʿUllayṣỉ [[بنو العليص]] in Ramaḍānủ [[رمضان]] of 291AH. In early 293AH he sends one of his missionaries, ʾAbū Ġānimỉȵ Naṣrủȵ [[أبو غانم نصر]], to the Palmyrene region, who again rallies his supporters and raids several cities before he is killed by unhappy followers. Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]]’s last envoy to that region is al-Ḳāsimủ bnủ ʾAḥmadả [[القاسم بن أحمد]] who promises the appearance of al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]] and who can again gather some 800 men to raid al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]] on the ʿĪdủ al-ʾAḍḥá [[عيد الأضحى]] of 293AH. When they retreat to al-Ṣawʾarủ [[الصوءر]], close to Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]]’s hiding place in al-Daryaŧủ [[الدرية]], he finally reveals himself and has al-Ḳāsimủ [[القاسم]] lead them to the edge of the area that is watered by the Euphrates near al-Ṣawʾarủ [[الصوءر]]. There the government troops catch up with them on 20th or 21st of Ḏū al-Ḥiǧǧaŧỉ [[ذو الحجة]] but are defeated by Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]]’s men. Encouraged by this victory they target the pilgrims’ caravan coming back from pilgrimage in al-Makkaŧủ [[المكة]]. On 13th or 14th of Muḥarramủ [[محرم]] in 294AH they encounter the second of three caravans at the standpipe of al-ʿAḳabaŧủ [[العقبة]]. After some resistence they beat the small escort and loot the riches they can find. The news from this defeat quickly reaches Baġdādủ [[بغداد]] and the government sends another army to save the third caravan. The two armies meet on 22nd Rabīʿủ al-ʾAwwalỉ [[ربيع الأول]] of 294AH in Wādī Ḏī Ḳārỉȵ [[وادي ذي قار]] and within the next two days the bedouins are slaughtered and Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]] is slain. His corpse is conserved, brought to Baġdādủ [[بغداد]] and shown to the public. Still for some time rumours are heard in the villages of al-Sawādủ [[السواد]] that Zakarūyaŧủȵ [[زكروية]] wasn’t dead but would soon reappear.
