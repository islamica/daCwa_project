BIO: Also from the district of Bašābūyaŧ [[بشابوية]], more specifically probably from Warsanān [[ورسنان]], Ġiyāṯ [[غياث]] takes him as lieutenant after he returns from Ḫurāsān [[خراسان]]. Later ʾAbū Ǧaʿfar [[أبو جعفر]], Ġiyāṯ [[غياث]]’s successor, makes him again his lieutenant when he is struck by melancholy. When ʾAbū Ǧaʿfar [[أبو جعفر]] recovers though, ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] refuses to give up his office and he succeeds as the fifth head dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] of al-Rayy [[الري]] at about 300AH. He is well-versed in Arabic poetry and in Ḥadīṯ [[حديث]] literature. His Kitāb al-Zīnaŧ [[كتاب الزينة]] fits the description of Ġiyāṯ [[غياث]]’s Kitāb al-Bayān [[كتاب البيان]] very well so that we can assume a direct connection between these two books. His is a very active period and he sends duʿāŧ [[دعاة]] to the neighbouring provinces, such as Ṭabaristān [[طبرستان]], ʾIṣfahān [[إصفهان]], ʾĀḏarbayǧān [[آذربيجان]] and Ǧurǧān [[جرجان]]. He even succeeds in converting al-ʾamīr [[الأمير]] of al-Rayy [[الري]], ʾAḥmad bn ʿAlī [[أحمد بن علي]]. Possibly directly after ʾAḥmad bn ʿAlī [[أحمد بن علي]] is killed in 311AH, he goes to Ṭabaristān [[طبرستان]] and joins the daylamī [[ديلمي]] ruler ʾAsfār bn Šīrawayh [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] whom he can convince of his theological positions. In 316AH ʾAsfār bn Šīrawayh [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] conquers al-Rayy [[الري]] and ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] follows him, and when he is killed and overtaken in the same year by Mardāwīǧ [[مرداويج]], he stays in favour with al-ʾamīr [[الأمير]]. Probably under Mardāwīǧ [[مرداويج]]’s rule the famous disputations between him and ʾAbū Bakr al-Rāzī [[أبو بكر الرازي]] take place, of which an account is given by himself in his book ʾAʿlām al-Nubūwaŧ [[أعلام النبوة]]. However, after the day passed when, according to his promise, al-ʾImām [[الإمام]] was supposed to appear, he fell in the esteem of his followers and, fearing for his life, he has to flee. He turns to the court of Mufliḥ [[مفلح]] in ʾĀḏarbayǧān [[آذربيجان]], whom he supposedly converts, where he dies in 322AH. [@stern_early_1960]
