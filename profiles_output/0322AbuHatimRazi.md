BIO: Also from the district of Bašābūyaŧủ [[بشابوية]], more specifically probably from Warsanānủ [[ورسنان]], Ġiyāṯủ [[غياث]] takes him as lieutenant after he returns from Ḫurāsānủ [[خراسان]]. Later ʾAbū Ǧaʿfarả [[أبو جعفر]], Ġiyāṯủ [[غياث]]’s successor, makes him again his lieutenant when he is struck by melancholy. When ʾAbū Ǧaʿfarả [[أبو جعفر]] recovers though, ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] refuses to give up his office and he succeeds as the fifth head dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] of Rayyủ [[ري]] at about 300AH. He is well-versed in Arabic poetry and in Ḥadīṯủȵ [[حديث]] literature. His Kitābủ al-Zīnaŧỉ [[كتاب الزينة]] fits the description of Ġiyāṯủ [[غياث]]’s Kitābủ al-Bayānỉ [[كتاب البيان]] very well so that we can assume a direct connections between these two books. His is a very active period and he sends duʿāŧủȵ [[دعاة]] to the neighbouring provinces, such as Ṭabaristānủ [[طبرستان]], ʾIṣfahānủ [[إصفهان]], ʾĀḏarbayǧānủ [[آذربيجان]] and Ǧurǧānủ [[جرجان]]. He even succeeds in converting al-ʾamīrủ [[الأمير]] of Rayyủ [[ري]], ʾAḥmadủ bnủ ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أحمد بن علي]]. Possibly directly after ʾAḥmadủ bnủ ʿAlīyỉȵ [[أحمد بن علي]] is killed in 311AH, he goes to Ṭabaristānủ [[طبرستان]] and joins the daylamīyủȵ [[ديلمي]] ruler ʾAsfārủ bnủ Šīrawayhỉ [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] whom he can convince of his theological positions. In 316AH ʾAsfārủ bnủ Šīrawayhỉ [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] conquers Rayyủ [[ري]] and ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] follows him, and when he is killed and overtaken in the same year by Mardāwīǧủ [[مرداويج]], he stays in favour with al-ʾamīrủ [[الأمير]]. Probably under Mardāwīǧủ [[مرداويج]]’s rule the famous disputations between him and ʾAbū Bakrỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو بكر الرازي]] take place, of which an account is given by himself in his book ʾAʿlāmủ al-Nubūwaŧỉ [[أعلام النبوة]]. However, after the day passed when, according to his promise, al-ʾImāmủ [[الإمام]] was supposed to appear, he fell in the esteem of his followers and, fearing for his life, he has to flee. He turns to the court of Mufliḥủȵ [[مفلح]] in ʾĀḏarbayǧānủ [[آذربيجان]], whom he supposedly converts, where he dies in 322AH. #Stern
