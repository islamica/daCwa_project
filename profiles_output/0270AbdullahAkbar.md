BIO: He is the founder of the ʾismāʿīlīyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] teachings. He hails from the village Ḳūraǧủ alʿAbbāsỉ [[قورج العباس]] close to al-ʾAhwāzủ [[الأهواز]] and in the first half of the third hiǧrīyủȵ [[هجري]] century lives in ʿAskarủ Mukramỉȵ [[عسكر مكرم]] in Ḫuzistānủ [[خزستان]]. The author Ibnủ Rizāmỉȵ [[ابن رزام]] claims that he is the son of Maymūnủȵ al-Ḳaddāḥủ [[ميمون القداح]], but which seems to be unlikely. After he starts proclaiming his teachings he has to flee from ʿAskarủ Mukramỉȵ [[عسكر مكرم]] and together with one of his followers, al-Ḥusaynủ al-ʾAhwāzīyủ [[الحسين الأهوازي]], takes residence in al-Baṣraŧủ [[البصرة]]. He lives with clients of the family of ʿAḳīlủȵ bnủ ʾAbī Ṭālibỉȵ [[عقيل بن أبي طالب]] from the Banū Bāhilaŧỉȵ [[بنو باهلة]] and tells them that he is a descendent from ʿAḳīlủȵ [[عقيل]], claiming to belong to al-Hāšimīyūnả [[الهاشميون]], the house of the prophet. However, when he still proclaims his teachings publicly the people from ʿAskarủ Mukramỉȵ [[عسكر مكرم]] hear of it and ʿAbdủ Allãhỉ [[عبد الله]] and al-Ḥusaynủ al-ʾAhwāzīyủ [[الحسين الأهوازي]] have to flee again, this time to Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] in Sūriyā [[سوريا]]. There he succesfully disguises himself as a merchant from al-Baṣraŧủ [[البصرة]] and finally has a respectable mansion built from where he resides as al-Ḥuǧǧaŧủ [[الحجة]] and that shall become the center of al-daʿwaŧủ [[الدعوة]] for the forseeable future. He gets married in Čālūsủ [[چالوس]], one of the early areas of the mission. Other areas where his missionaries are sent, are the town of Rayyủ [[ري]] in North West ʾĪrānủ [[إيران]], where Ḫalafủȵ [[خلف]] starts an ʾismāʿīlīyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] community, and al-Sawādủ [[السواد]] in the countryside of al-Kūfaŧủ [[الكوفة]], where ʿAbdủ Allãhỉ [[عبد الله]] sends one of his early loyal followers, al-Ḥusaynủ al-ʾAhwāzīyủ [[الحسين الأهوازي]], in 261AH or 264AH. The cell in al-ʿIrāḳủ [[العراق]] doesn’t communicate directly with Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] though, but through Ṭāliḳānủ [[طالقان]]. His exact date of death is unknown, but he leaves two sons, ʾIbrāhīmủ [[إبراهيم]] and ʾAḥmadủ [[أحمد]], the latter of which becomes his successor. His grave is not known, but al-Fāṭimīyūnả [[الفاطميون]] later build Maḳāmủ al-ʾImāmỉ [[مقام الإمام]] in Salamīyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] that is still revered as his resting place today.
