BIO: He is the founder of the ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] teachings. He hails from the village Ḳūraǧ alʿAbbās [[قورج العباس]] close to al-ʾAhwāz [[الأهواز]] [U:AHWAZ_486E313N_S] and in the first half of the third hiǧrī [[هجري]] century lives in ʿAskar Mukram [[عسكر مكرم]] [U:ASKARMUKRAM_488E316N_S]. The author Ibn Rizām [[ابن رزام]] (NOURI) claims that he is the son of Maymūn al-Ḳaddāḥ [[ميمون القداح]] (NOURI), but which seems to be unlikely. After he starts proclaiming his teachings he has to flee from ʿAskar Mukram [[عسكر مكرم]] [U:ASKARMUKRAM_488E316N_S] and together with one of his followers, al-Ḥusayn al-ʾAhwāzī [[الحسين الأهوازي]] (NOURI), takes residence in al-Baṣraŧ [[البصرة]] [U:BASRA_477E304N_S]. He lives with clients of the family of ʿAḳīl bn ʾAbī Ṭālib [[عقيل بن أبي طالب]] (NOURI) from the Banū Bāhilaŧ [[بنو باهلة]] and tells them that he is a descendent from ʿAḳīl [[عقيل]] (NOURI), claiming to belong to al-Hāšimīyūn [[الهاشميون]], the house of the prophet. However, when he still proclaims his teachings publicly the people from ʿAskar Mukram [[عسكر مكرم]] [U:ASKARMUKRAM_488E316N_S] hear of it and ʿAbd Allãh [[عبد الله]] and al-Ḥusayn al-ʾAhwāzī [[الحسين الأهوازي]] (NOURI) have to flee again, this time to Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S]. There he succesfully disguises himself as a merchant from al-Baṣraŧ [[البصرة]] [U:BASRA_477E304N_S] and finally has a respectable mansion built from where he resides as al-Ḥuǧǧaŧ [[الحجة]] and that shall become the center of al-daʿwaŧ [[الدعوة]] for the forseeable future. He gets married in Šālūs [[شالوس]] [U:SHALUS_514E366N_S], one of the early areas of the mission. Other areas where his missionaries are sent, are the town of al-Rayy [[الري]] [U:RAYY_515E356N_S], where Ḫalaf [[خلف]] [U:0275Khalaf] starts an ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] community, and al-Sawād [[السواد]] in the countryside of al-Kūfaŧ [[الكوفة]] [U:KUFA_443E320N_S], where ʿAbd Allãh [[عبد الله]] sends one of his early loyal followers, al-Ḥusayn al-ʾAhwāzī [[الحسين الأهوازي]] (NOURI), in 261AH or 264AH. The cell in al-ʿIrāḳ [[العراق]]

 doesn’t communicate directly with Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S] though, but through Ṭalaḳān [[طلقان]] [U:TALAQAN_508E361N_R]. His exact date of death is unknown, but he leaves two sons, ʾIbrāhīm [[إبراهيم]] (NOURI) and ʾAḥmad [[أحمد]] (NOURI), the latter of which becomes his successor. His grave is not known, but al-Fāṭimīyūn [[الفاطميون]] later build Maḳām al-ʾImām [[مقام الإمام]] in Salamīyaŧ [[سلمية]] [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S] that is still revered as his resting place today.
