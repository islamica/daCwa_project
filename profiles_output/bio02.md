BIO: al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]] is the founder of the communities in the Gulf region. He is of Persian descent and originally comes from Ǧannābaŧủ [[جنابة]]. After he marries into a converted family in al-Sawādủ [[السواد]] either Ḥamdānủȵ Ḳarmaṭủȵ [[حمدان قرمط]] or ʿAbdānủȵ [[عبدان]] makes him a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]]. He goes back to his homeland and carries al-daʿwaŧủ [[الدعوة]] to Ǧannābaŧủ [[جنابة]], Sīnīzủ [[سينيز]], Ṭawwaǧủ [[طوج]] and Mahrūbānủ [[مهروبان]] as well as in the coast area of al-Fārsủ [[الفارس]]. He collects taxes from converts, but soon opposition arises. He has to flee and meets up with Ḳarmaṭủȵ [[قرمط]] who believes in his abilities and sends him with new support to al-Baḥraynủ [[البحرين]]. In 286AH he settles in al-Ḳaṭīfủ [[القطيف]] and works as a flour merchant. His first followers are three brothers with the name of ʿAliyyủȵ [[علي]], Ḥamdānủȵ [[حمدان]] and al-Ḥasanủ bnủ Sanbarỉȵ [[الحسن بن سنبر]] and their families. Very soon he starts converting the bedouins outside the city and incites them to raids against the unbelievers. The first clan that joins al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]] are the Banū al-ʾAḍbaṭỉ [[بنو الأضبط]] from the tribe Kilābủȵ [[كلاب]], a tribe that was cast out by the other tribes, following the promise of being in the first rank of the coming kingdom of God. In 286AH al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]]’s men occupy al-Ḳaṭīfủ [[القطيف]], in 287AH they are spotted close to al-Baṣraŧủ [[البصرة]], their main interest is the oasis of Haǧarủȵ [[هجر]] though on which they lay siege. In the close town of al-ʾAḥsāʾủ [[الأحساء]] he constructs a dārủ al-hiǧraŧỉ [[دار الهجرة]] for the region, from where al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]] reigns like a prince. When the siege of Haǧarủȵ [[هجر]] is still under way the alarmed caliph al-Muʿtaḍidủ [[المعتضد]] has 2,000 men sent from al-Baṣraŧủ [[البصرة]] to the oases of al-Baḥraynủ [[البحرين]] to regain control. However, at the end of Raǧabủȵ [[رجب]] in 287AH they are defeated by al-ʾIsmāʿīliyyūnả [[الإسماعيليون]]. al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]] has the allegedly 700 captives killed except for the commanding officer who is sent back to the caliph to Baġdādủ [[بغداد]]. Later in the same year Haǧarủȵ [[هجر]] is taken and destroyed, and whoever decides not to convert has to flee. When the schism between the headquarters in Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] and al-Ḳarmaṭiyyūnả [[القرمطيون]] happens, al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]] and his ǧazīraŧủȵ [[جزيرة]] follow his mentors in al-Sawādủ [[السواد]]; he has his opponent ʾAbū Zakariyyāʾả al-Ḍammāmiyyủ [[أبو زكرياء الضمامي]], a loyalist to al-Fāṭimiyyūnả [[الفاطميون]] killed. At the end of 299AH there is a raid on al-Sūḳủ [[السوق]] of al-Baṣraŧủ [[البصرة]]. In Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧỉ [[ذو القعدة]] of 300AH al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]] is murdered by one of his slaves, maybe as a result of al-Mahdiyyủ [[المهدي]] not appearing when al-Ǧannābiyyủ [[الجنابي]] had prophesied so. One of his six sons follows as his succesor.
