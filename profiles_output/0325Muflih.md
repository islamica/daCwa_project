BIO: He is a ġulāmủȵ [[غلام]] of Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]], who conquers Rayyủ [[ري]] in Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧỉ [[ذو القعدة]] of 311AH. When Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]] leaves for Hamaḏānủ [[همذان]] in 312AH he leaves Mufliḥủȵ [[مفلح]] in his place. However, he seems to have antagonized the people with the result that he abandons the post and rejoins Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]]. When in 317AH Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]]’s nephew, ʾAbū al-Musāfirỉ Fatḥủȵ [[أبو المسافر فتح]], is killed, he establishes himself as an independent ruler in ʾĀḏarbayǧānủ [[آذربيجان]]. In 319AH he is making war on the Byzantines and in 320AH he strikes coins in ʾArdabīlủ [[أردبيل]]. In that same year he apparently has to flee from ʾĀḏarbayǧānủ [[آذربيجان]] from a certain Baldawayhỉ [[بلدويه]] and seeks refuge with Yazīdủ [[يزيد]], the ruler of Šarwānủ [[شروان]], but who surrenders him to his enemy. However, his name is mentioned on coins from ʾĀḏarbayǧānủ [[آذربيجان]] and Bardaʿaŧủ [[بردعة]] in the year 323AH, so he must have succeeded in overcoming these difficulties. Already one year before that, in 322AH his court becomes ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]’s refuge who has to flee from Rayyủ [[ري]]. It is said that he succeeds in converting Mufliḥủȵ [[مفلح]], the exact extent of his belief in the ʾismāʿīlīyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] doctrines we can’t know though. ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] dies shortly after at the court of Mufliḥủȵ [[مفلح]]. #Stern
