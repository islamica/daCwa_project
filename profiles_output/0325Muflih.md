BIO: He is a ġulām [[غلام]] of Yūsuf bn ʾAbī al-Sāǧ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]], who conquers al-Rayy [[الري]] in Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧ [[ذو القعدة]] of 311AH. When Yūsuf bn ʾAbī al-Sāǧ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]] leaves for Hamaḏān [[همذان]] in 312AH he leaves Mufliḥ [[مفلح]] in his place. However, he seems to have antagonized the people with the result that he abandons the post and rejoins Yūsuf bn ʾAbī al-Sāǧ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]]. When in 317AH Yūsuf bn ʾAbī al-Sāǧ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]]’s nephew, ʾAbū al-Musāfir Fatḥ [[أبو المسافر فتح]], is killed, he establishes himself as an independent ruler in ʾĀḏarbayǧān [[آذربيجان]]. In 319AH he is making war on the Byzantines and in 320AH he strikes coins in ʾArdabīl [[أردبيل]]. In that same year he apparently has to flee from ʾĀḏarbayǧān [[آذربيجان]] from a certain Baldawayh [[بلدويه]] and seeks refuge with Yazīd [[يزيد]], the ruler of Šarwān [[شروان]], but who surrenders him to his enemy. However, his name is mentioned on coins from ʾĀḏarbayǧān [[آذربيجان]] and Bardaʿaŧ [[بردعة]] in the year 323AH, so he must have succeeded in overcoming these difficulties. Already one year before that, in 322AH his court becomes ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]’s refuge who has to flee from al-Rayy [[الري]]. It is said that he succeeds in converting Mufliḥ [[مفلح]], the exact extent of his belief in the ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] doctrines we can’t know though. ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] dies shortly after at the court of Mufliḥ [[مفلح]].
