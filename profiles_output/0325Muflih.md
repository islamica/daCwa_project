BIO: He is a ġulāmủȵ [[غلام]] of Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]], who conquers Rayyủ [[ري]] in Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧỉ [[ذو القعدة]] of 311AH. When Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]] leaves for Hamaḏānủ [[همذان]] in 312AH he leaves Mufliḥủȵ [[مفلح]] in his place. However, he seems to have antagonized the people with the result that he abandons the post and rejoins Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]]. When in 317AH Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]]’s nephew, ʾAbū al-Musāfirỉ Fatḥủȵ [[أبو المسافر فتح]], is killed, he establishes himself as an independent ruler in ʾĀḏarbayǧānủ [[آذربيجان]]. #Stern
