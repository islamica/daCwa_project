BIO: In 316AH he, like ʾAsfār bn Šīrawayh [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] a daylamī [[ديلمي]], overtakes the throne by killing him. Since ʾAsfār bn Šīrawayh [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] had declared his allegiance to al-Sāmānīyūn [[السامانيون]], he stays antagonistic to them. He has several military clashes with them, one of the in Ǧurǧān [[جرجان]] in 321AH. He seems to be a follower of ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]’s doctrines as well, and according to Ḥamīd al-Dīn al-Kirmānī [[حميد الدين الكرماني]] it is under his rule that the famous disputations betweend ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] and ʾAbū Bakr al-Rāzī [[أبو بكر الرازي]] take place. Because of his allegiance with al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūn [[الإسماعيليون]] it is rumoured that he aimed at marching on Baġdād [[بغداد]] and overthrowing the ʿabbāsī [[عباسي]] caliph. However, after the day passed when, according to ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]’s promise, al-ʾImām [[الإمام]] was supposed to appear, he fell in the esteem of his followers. Mardāwīǧ [[مرداويج]]’s last years are characterized by savage persecution of the sect. He rules until 323AH. [@stern_early_1960]
