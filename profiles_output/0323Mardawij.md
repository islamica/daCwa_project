BIO: In 316AH he, like ʾAsfārủ bnủ Šīrawayhỉ [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] a daylamīyủȵ [[ديلمي]], overtakes the throne by killing him. Since ʾAsfārủ bnủ Šīrawayhỉ [[أسفار بن شيرويه]] had declared his allegiance to al-Sāmānīyūnả [[السامانيون]], he stays antagonistic to them. He has several military clashes with them, one of the in Ǧurǧānủ [[جرجان]] in 321AH. He seems to be a follower of ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]’s doctrines as well, and according to Ḥamīdủ al-Dīnỉ al-Kirmānīyủ [[حميد الدين الكرماني]] it is under his rule that the famous disputations betweend ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] and ʾAbū Bakrỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو بكر الرازي]] take place. Because of his allegiance with al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūnả [[الإسماعيليون]] it is rumoured that he aimed at marching on Baġdādủ [[بغداد]] and overthrowing the ʿabbāsīyủȵ [[عباسي]] caliph. However, after the day passed when, according to ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]’s promise, al-ʾImāmủ [[الإمام]] was supposed to appear, he fell in the esteem of his followers. Mardāwīǧủ [[مرداويج]]’s last years are characterized by savage persecution of the sect. He rules until 323AH. #Stern
