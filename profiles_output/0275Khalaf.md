BIO: According to the sources we have he is sent to al-Rayy [[الري]] [U:RAYY_515E356N_S] by ʿAbd Allãh al-ʾAkbar [[عبد الله الأكبر]] [U:0270AbdullahAkbar] himself with the mission of converting al-Šīʿīyūn [[الشيعيون]] in North-West ʾĪrān [[إيران]] [U:al-Jibāl]

 He establishes himself in one of the villages around al-Rayy [[الري]] [U:RAYY_515E356N_S], Kulīn [[كلين]]. According to Niẓām al-Mulk [[نظام الملك]]’s (NOURI) Siyāsat Nāmih [[سياست نامه]] he says to his disciples that his was the doctrine of the House of the Prophet, which must, however, be kept secret until the appearance of al-Ḳāʾim [[القائم]], when it would be manifested. The appearance of al-Ḳāʾim [[القائم]] was near; it was, therefore, necessary to receive instruction, so that when he appears one should not be found ignorant of the doctrine. After he is overheard preaching by men of his village and the subsequent distrust towards him, he decides to flee to al-Rayy [[الري]] [U:RAYY_515E356N_S] where he dies. His name continues to live on as al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyaŧ [[الإسماعيلية]] of the province become also known as al-Ḫalafīyaŧ [[الخلفية]]. [@stern_early_1960]
