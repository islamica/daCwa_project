BIO: According to the sources we have he is sent to Rayyủ [[ري]] by ʿAbdủ Allãhỉ al-ʾAkbarủ [[عبد الله الأكبر]] himself with the mission of converting al-Šīʿīyūnả [[الشيعيون]] in North-West ʾĪrānủ [[إيران]]. He establishes himself in one of the villages around Rayyủ [[ري]], Kulīnủ [[كلين]] in the district Bašābūyaŧủ [[بشابوية]]. According to Niẓāmủ al-Mulkỉ [[نظام الملك]]’s Siyāsat Nāmih [[سياست نامه]] he saiys to his disciples that his was the doctrine of the House of the Prophet, which must, however, be kept secret until the appearance of al-Ḳāʾimủ [[القائم]], when it would be manifested. The appearance of al-Ḳāʾimủ [[القائم]] was near; it was, therefore, necessary to receive instruction, so that when he appears one should not be found ignorant of the doctrine. After he is overheard preaching by men of his village and the subsequent distrust towards him, he decides to flee to Rayyủ [[ري]] where he dies. His name continues to live on as al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūnả [[الإسماعيليون]] of the province become also known as al-Ḫalafīyaŧủ [[الخلفية]] #Stern
