BIO: He is the governor of Rayyủ [[ري]] from 307AH to 311AH and is converted by ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]. However, he doesn’t declare his allegiance publicly, so we don’t know to what degree he supports ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]. At the end of Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧỉ [[ذو القعدة]] of 311AH he is killed by his political opponent Yūsufủ bnủ ʾAbī al-Sāǧỉ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]], who reclaims the city for the ʿabbāsīyủȵ [[عباسي]] authorities. #Stern
