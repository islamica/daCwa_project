BIO: He is the governor of al-Rayy [[الري]] from 307AH to 311AH and is converted by ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]. However, he doesn’t declare his allegiance publicly, so we don’t know to what degree he supports ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]. At the end of Ḏū al-Ḳaʿdaŧ [[ذو القعدة]] of 311AH he is killed by his political opponent Yūsuf bn ʾAbī al-Sāǧ [[يوسف بن أبي الساج]], who reclaims the city for the ʿabbāsī [[عباسي]] authorities.
