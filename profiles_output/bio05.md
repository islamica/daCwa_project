BIO: He is the founder of the ʾismāʿīliyyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] teachings. He hails from the village Ḳūraǧủ alʿAbbāsỉ [[قورج العباس]] close to al-ʾAhwāzủ [[الأهواز]] and in the first half of the third hiǧriyyủȵ [[هجري]] century lives in ʿAskarủ Mukramỉȵ [[عسكر مكرم]] in Ḫuzistānủ [[خزستان]]. The author Ibnủ Rizāmỉȵ [[ابن رزام]] claims that he is the son of Maymūnủȵ al-Ḳaddāḥủ [[ميمون القداح]], but which seems to be unlikely. After he starts proclaiming his teachings he has to flee from ʿAskarủ Mukramỉȵ [[عسكر مكرم]] and together with one of his followers, al-Ḥusaynủ al-ʾAhwāziyyủ [[الحسين الأهوازي]], takes residence in al-Baṣraŧủ [[البصرة]]. He lives with clients of the family of ʿAḳīlủȵ bnủ ʾAbī Ṭālibỉȵ [[عقيل بن أبي طالب]] from the Banū Bāhilaŧỉȵ [[بنو باهلة]] and tells them that he is a descendent from ʿAḳīlủȵ [[عقيل]], claiming to belong to al-Hāšimiyyūnả [[الهاشميون]], the house of the prophet. However, when he still proclaims his teachings publicly the people from ʿAskarủ Mukramỉȵ [[عسكر مكرم]] hear of it and ʿAbdủ Allãhỉ [[عبد الله]] and al-Ḥusaynủ al-ʾAhwāziyyủ [[الحسين الأهوازي]] have to flee again, this time to Salamiyyaŧủȵ [[سلمية]] in Sūriyā [[سوريا]]. There he succesfully disguises himself as a merchant from al-Baṣraŧủ [[البصرة]] and finally has a respectable mansion built that shall becom the center of al-daʿwaŧủ [[الدعوة]] for the forseeable future. His exact date of death is unknown, but he leaves two sons, ʾIbrāhīmủ [[إبراهيم]] and ʾAḥmadủ [[أحمد]], the latter of which becomes his successor.
