BIO: Ġiyāṯủ [[غياث]] hails from the village of Kulīnủ [[كلين]] where al-daʿwaŧủ [[الدعوة]] of al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūnả [[الإسماعيليون]] in North-West ʾĪrānủ [[إيران]] starts and where ʾAḥmadủ bnủ Ḫalafỉȵ [[أحمد بن خلف]] successfully converts him. He is a man accomplished in the study of al-ʾadabủ [[الأدب]] and writes a book, called Kitābủ al-Bayānỉ [[كتاب البيان]], a dictionary of religious technical terms. Specifically ʾismāʿīlīyủȵ [[إسماعيلي]] features are absent so that the readers wouldn’t notice its author’s creed at the first glance. He holds disputations with sunnīyủȵ [[سني]] theologians and his fame reaches as far as Ḳummủ [[قم]] and Ḳāšānủ [[قاشان]]. After ʿAbdủ Allãhỉ al-Zaʿfarānīyủ [[عبد الله الزعفراني]] rouses the inhabitants of Rayyủ [[ري]] against him he has to flee to Ḫurāsānủ [[خراسان]]. There, in Marwủ al-Rūḏỉ [[مرو الروذ]] he meets al-Ḥusaynủ bnủ ʿAlīyỉȵ al-Marwả-al-Rūḏīyủ [[الحسين بن علي المروالروذي]], who is an ʾamīrủȵ [[أمير]]. After appointing a lieutenant in Marwủ al-Rūḏỉ [[مرو الروذ]] he returns to Rayyủ [[ري]] and there takes ʾAbū Ḥātimỉȵ al-Rāzīyủ [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] as his lieutenant. After the date which he foretold for the coming of al-Mahdīyủ [[المهدي]] passed by and his persecution continues Niẓāmủ al-Mulkỉ [[نظام الملك]] says that he goes off, discouraged, and is not seen any more. #Stern
