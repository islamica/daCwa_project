BIO: Ġiyāṯ [[غياث]] hails from the village of Kulīn [[كلين]] close to al-Rayy [[الري]] [U:RAYY_515E356N_S] where al-daʿwaŧ [[الدعوة]] of al-ʾIsmāʿīlīyūn [[الإسماعيليون]] in North-West ʾĪrān [[إيران]] starts and where ʾAḥmad bn Ḫalaf [[أحمد بن خلف]] successfully converts him. He is a man accomplished in the study of al-ʾadab [[الأدب]] and writes a book, called Kitāb al-Bayān [[كتاب البيان]], a dictionary of religious technical terms. Specifically ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] features are absent so that the readers wouldn’t notice its author’s creed at the first glance. He holds disputations with sunnī [[سني]] theologians and his fame reaches as far as Ḳumm [[قم]] [U:QUMM_509E346N_S] and Ḳāšān [[قاشان]] [U:QASHAN_515E339N_S]. After ʿAbd Allãh al-Zaʿfarānī [[عبد الله الزعفراني]] rouses the inhabitants of al-Rayy [[الري]] [U:RAYY_515E356N_S] against him he has to flee to Ḫurāsān [[خراسان]]. There, in Marw al-Rūḏ [[مرو الروذ]] [U:MARWRUDH_633E355N_S] he meets al-Ḥusayn bn ʿAlī al-Marwả-al-Rūḏī [[الحسين بن علي المروالروذي]], who is an ʾamīr [[أمير]]. After appointing a lieutenant in Marw al-Rūḏ [[مرو الروذ]] [U:MARWRUDH_633E355N_S] he returns to al-Rayy [[الري]] [U:RAYY_515E356N_S] and there takes ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] as his lieutenant. After the date for which he foretold for the coming of al-Mahdī [[المهدي]] passed by and his persecution continues Niẓām al-Mulk [[نظام الملك]] says that he goes off, discouraged, and is not seen any more.
