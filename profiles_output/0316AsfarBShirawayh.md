BIO: He is a daylamī [[ديلمي]] ruler who extended his rule to Ṭabaristān [[طبرستان]] where he meets ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]] who can convert him. How far his allegiance to the ʾismāʿīlī [[إسماعيلي]] faith goes, is unknown. According to al-Daylamī [[الديلمي]] he is converted in Ǧurǧān [[جرجان]] by a dāʿỉȵ [[داع]] with the name ʾAbū ʿAlī [[أبو علي]], who is possibly a subordinate of ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī [[أبو حاتم الرازي]]. In 316AH he conquers al-Rayy [[الري]]. He declares his allegiance to al-Sāmānīyūn [[السامانيون]], but is killed and overtaken still in the same year by Mardāwīǧ [[مرداويج]]. [@stern_early_1960]
