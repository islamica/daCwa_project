BIO: He is the brother-in-law of @@*Hamd_an?u*n Qarma*t?u*n@@ and like him comes from @@Quss?u Bahr_am?i*n@@ close to @@B_abil@@. They are converted together by @@al-*Husayn?u al-'Ahw_aziyy?u@@ either in 261AH or 264AH. Following this they head the mission in @@al-Saw_ad?u@@, with @@`Abd_an?u*n@@ focussing on the rural areas. From his converts he appoints a head @@d_a`?i*n@@ for each district that each have a number of @@du`_a=t?u*n@@. Among the bedouins he is likewise successful, the majority of them joins @@al-da`wa=t?u@@. From the converts he and his brother-in-law collect taxes in the name of the promised @@al-Mahdiyy?u@@, that are either sent to @@Salamiyya=t?u*n@@ or saved locally, they enjoin on their followers the principle of @@al-'ulfa=t?u@@, meaning that everyone has to share their material belongings with all the other believers, and from 276AH they command them to buy and secretly store weapons. During all this @@`Abd_an?u*n@@ is in close contact with the @@al-*Hujja=t?u@@ @@'Ab_u al-^Sala*gla*g?i@@ in @@Salamiyya=t?u*n@@ via carrier pigeons. In the year 277AH or 279AH he begins to fortify a @@d_ar?u al-hijra=t?i@@ in the village @@Mahtam_ab_ad?u@@ in the province @@al-Fur_at?u@@ close to @@al-K_ufa=t?u@@. Only during summer 284AH the gouvernor of @@al-K_ufa=t?u@@ starts to approach the @@'ism_a`_iliyy?u*n@@ villages in @@al-Saw_ad?u@@ militarilly and sends some of the arrested @@'Ism_a`_iliyy_un?a@@ to @@Ba*gd_ad?u@@. From the interrogations it becomes apparent that the connections of @@*Hamd_an?u*n Qarma*t?u*n@@ and @@`Abd_an?u*n@@ even reached officials in @@Ba*gd_ad?u@@. When @@'Ab_u al-^Sala*gla*g?i@@ passes away in 286AH his brother-in-law becomes suspicious of the true intentions of @@Sa`_id?u*n bn?u al-*Husayn?i@@, his successor as @@al-*Hujja=t?u@@ and sends him to the headquarters in @@Salamiyya=t?u*n@@. After it becomes clear to him that @@Sa`_id?u*n bn?u al-*Husayn?i@@ isn’t advancing the cause of the hidden @@al-'Im_am?u@@ @@Mu*hammad?u*n bn?u 'Ism_a`_il?a@@ but considers himself as the true @@al-Mahdiyy?u@@ he and his brother-in-law instruct all the @@du`_a=t?u*n@@ in @@al-Saw_ad?u@@ to suspend @@al-da`wa=t?u@@ and the schism of @@al-Qarma*tiyy_un?a@@ ensues. He is later visited by an envoy from @@Sa`_id?u*n bn?u al-*Husayn?i@@, probably a brother of his, who tries to win back his loyalty. When he doesn’t succeed he incites @@Zakar_uya=t?u*n bn?u Mihr_uya=t?i*n@@, a son of one of @@`Abd_an?u*n@@’s first followers, to plotting his murder. This plot succeeds and followers of @@Zakar_uya=t?u*n bn?u Mihr_uya=t?i*n@@ from the clan @@Tam_im?u*n@@ of the tribe @@Kulayb?u*n@@ who live west of @@al-K_ufa=t?u@@ kill him during a night in his home in the village @@N_as_ur_a@@. At least until 315AH his followers still act in the name of the hidden @@al-'Im_am?u@@ @@Mu*hammad?u*n bn?u 'Ism_a`_il?a@@, have scriptures with his alleged authorship circulate and believe that he is still alive.
