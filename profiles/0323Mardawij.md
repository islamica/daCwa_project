BIO: In 316AH he, like @@'Asf_ar bn ^S_irawayh@@ a @@daylam_i@@, overtakes the throne by killing him. Since @@'Asf_ar bn ^S_irawayh@@ had declared his allegiance to @@al-S_am_an_iy_un@@, he stays antagonistic to them. He has several military clashes with them, one of the in @@Jurj_an@@ in 321AH. He seems to be a follower of @@'Ab_u *H_atim al-R_az_i@@’s doctrines as well, and according to @@*Ham_id al-D_in al-Kirm_an_i@@ it is under his rule that the famous disputations betweend @@'Ab_u *H_atim al-R_az_i@@ and @@'Ab_u Bakr al-R_az_i@@ take place. Because of his allegiance with @@al-'Ism_a`_il_iy_un@@ it is rumoured that he aimed at marching on @@Ba*gd_ad@@ and overthrowing the @@`abb_as_i@@ caliph. However, after the day passed when, according to @@'Ab_u *H_atim al-R_az_i@@’s promise, @@al-'Im_am@@ was supposed to appear, he fell in the esteem of his followers. @@Mard_aw_ij@@’s last years are characterized by savage persecution of the sect. He rules until 323AH. [@stern_early_1960]
