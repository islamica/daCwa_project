Since @@'Asf_ar?u bn?u ^S_irawayh?i@@ had declared his allegiance to @@al-S_am_an_iy_un?a@@, he stays antagonistic to them. He has several military clashes with them, one of the in @@Jurj_an?u@@ in 321AH. He seems to be a follower of @@'Ab_u *H_atim?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@’s doctrines as well, and according to @@*Ham_id?u al-D_in?i al-Kirm_an_iy?u@@ it is under his rule that the famous disputations betweend @@'Ab_u *H_atim?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@ and @@'Ab_u Bakr?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@ take place.
