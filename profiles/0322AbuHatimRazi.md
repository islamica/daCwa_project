BIO: Also from the district of @@Ba^s_ab_uya=t@@, more specifically probably from @@Warsan_an@@, @@*Giy_a_t@@ takes him as lieutenant after he returns from @@_Hur_as_an@@. Later @@'Ab_u Ja`far@@, @@*Giy_a_t@@’s successor, makes him again his lieutenant when he is struck by melancholy. When @@'Ab_u Ja`far@@ recovers though, @@'Ab_u *H_atim al-R_az_i@@ refuses to give up his office and he succeeds as the fifth head @@d_a`?i*n@@ of @@al-Rayy@@ at about 300AH. He is well-versed in Arabic poetry and in @@*Had_i_t@@ literature. His @@Kit_ab al-Z_ina=t@@ fits the description of @@*Giy_a_t@@’s @@Kit_ab al-Bay_an@@ very well so that we can assume a direct connection between these two books. His is a very active period and he sends @@du`_a=t@@ to the neighbouring provinces, such as @@*Tabarist_an@@, @@'I*sfah_an@@, @@'_A_darbayj_an@@ and @@Jurj_an@@. He even succeeds in converting @@al-'am_ir@@ of @@al-Rayy@@, @@'A*hmad bn `Al_i@@. Possibly directly after @@'A*hmad bn `Al_i@@ is killed in 311AH, he goes to @@*Tabarist_an@@ and joins the @@daylam_i@@ ruler @@'Asf_ar bn ^S_irawayh@@ whom he can convince of his theological positions. In 316AH @@'Asf_ar bn ^S_irawayh@@ conquers @@al-Rayy@@ and @@'Ab_u *H_atim al-R_az_i@@ follows him, and when he is killed and overtaken in the same year by @@Mard_aw_ij@@, he stays in favour with @@al-'am_ir@@. Probably under @@Mard_aw_ij@@’s rule the famous disputations between him and @@'Ab_u Bakr al-R_az_i@@ take place, of which an account is given by himself in his book @@'A`l_am al-Nub_uwa=t@@. However, after the day passed when, according to his promise, @@al-'Im_am@@ was supposed to appear, he fell in the esteem of his followers and, fearing for his life, he has to flee. He turns to the court of @@Mufli*h@@ in @@'_A_darbayj_an@@, whom he supposedly converts, where he dies in 322AH. [@stern_early_1960]
