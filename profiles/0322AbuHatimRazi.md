BIO: Also from the district of @@Ba^s_ab_uya=t?u@@, more specifically probably from @@Warsan_an?u@@, @@*Giy_a_t?u@@ takes him as lieutenant after he returns from @@_Hur_as_an?u@@. Later @@'Ab_u Ja`far?a@@, @@*Giy_a_t?u@@’s successor, makes him again his lieutenant when he is struck by melancholy. When @@'Ab_u Ja`far?a@@ recovers though, @@'Ab_u *H_atim?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@ refuses to give up his office and he succeeds as the fifth head @@d_a`?i*n@@ of @@Rayy?u@@ at about 300AH. He is well-versed in Arabic poetry and in @@*Had_i_t?u*n@@ literature. His @@Kit_ab?u al-Z_ina=t?i@@ fits the description of @@*Giy_a_t?u@@’s @@Kit_ab?u al-Bay_an?i@@ very well so that we can assume a direct connections between these two books. His is a very active period and he sends @@du`_a=t?u*n@@ to the neighbouring provinces, such as @@*Tabarist_an?u@@, @@'I*sfah_an?u@@, @@'_A_darbayj_an?u@@ and @@Jurj_an?u@@. He even succeeds in converting @@al-'am_ir?u@@ of @@Rayy?u@@, @@'A*hmad?u bn?u `Al_iy?i*n@@. Possibly directly after @@'A*hmad?u bn?u `Al_iy?i*n@@ is killed in 311AH, he goes to @@*Tabarist_an?u@@ and joins the @@daylam_iy?u*n@@ ruler @@'Asf_ar?u bn?u ^S_irawayh?i@@ whom he can convince of his theological positions. In 316AH @@'Asf_ar?u bn?u ^S_irawayh?i@@ conquers @@Rayy?u@@ and @@'Ab_u *H_atim?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@ follows him, and when he is killed and overtaken in the same year by @@Mard_aw_ij?u@@, he stays in favour with @@al-'am_ir?u@@. Probably under @@Mard_aw_ij?u@@’s rule the famous disputations between him and @@'Ab_u Bakr?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@ take place, of which an account is given by himself in his book @@'A`l_am?u al-Nub_uwa=t?i@@. However, after the day passed when, according to his promise, @@al-'Im_am?u@@ was supposed to appear, he fell in the esteem of his followers and, fearing for his life, he has to flee. He turns to the court of @@Mufli*h?u*n@@ in @@'_A_darbayj_an?u@@, whom he supposedly converts, where he dies in 322AH. #Stern
