BIO: He is the founder of the @@'ism_a`_iliyy?u*n@@ teachings. He hails from the village @@Q_uraj?u al_`Abb_as?i@@ close to @@al-'Ahw_az?u@@ and in the first half of the third @@hijriyy?u*n@@ century lives in @@`Askar?u Mukram?i*n@@ in @@_Huzist_an?u@@. The author @@Ibn?u Riz_am?i*n@@ claims that he is the son of @@Maym_un?u*n al-Qadd_a*h?u@@, but which seems to be unlikely. After he starts proclaiming his teachings he has to flee from @@`Askar?u Mukram?i*n@@ and together with one of his followers, @@al-*Husayn?u al-'Ahw_aziyy?u@@, takes residence in @@al-Ba*sra=t?u@@. He lives with clients of the family of @@`Aq_il?u*n bn?u 'Ab_i *T_alib?i*n@@ from the @@Ban_u B_ahila=t?i*n@@ and tells them that he is a descendent from @@`Aq_il?u*n@@, claiming to belong to @@al-H_a^simiyy_un?a@@, the house of the prophet. However, when he still proclaims his teachings publicly the people from @@`Askar?u Mukram?i*n@@ hear of it and @@`Abd?u All~ah?i@@ and @@al-*Husayn?u al-'Ahw_aziyy?u@@ have to flee again, this time to @@Salamiyya=t?u*n@@ in @@S_uriy_a@@. There he succesfully disguises himself as a merchant from @@al-Ba*sra=t?u@@ and finally has a respectable mansion built that shall becom the center of @@al-da`wa=t?u@@ for the forseeable future. His exact date of death is unknown, but he leaves two sons, @@'Ibr_ah_im?u@@ and @@'A*hmad?u@@, the latter of which becomes his successor.
