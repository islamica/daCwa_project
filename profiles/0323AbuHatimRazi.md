BIO: Also from the district of @@Ba^s_ab_uya=t?u@@, more specifically probably from @@Warsan_an?u@@, @@*Giy_a_t?u@@ takes him as lieutenant after he returns from @@_Hur_as_an?u@@. Later @@'Ab_u Ja`far?a@@, @@*Giy_a_t?u@@’s successor, makes him again his lieutenant when he is struck by melancholy. When @@'Ab_u Ja`far?a@@ recovers though, @@'Ab_u *H_atim?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@ refuses to give up his office and he succeeds as the fifth head @@d_a`?i*n@@ of @@Rayy?u@@ at about 300AH. He is well-versed in Arabic poetry and in @@*Had_i_t?u*n@@ literature. His @@Kit_ab?u al-Z_ina=t?i@@ fits the description of @@*Giy_a_t?u@@’s @@Kit_ab?u al-Bay_an?i@@ very well so that we can assume a direct connections between these two books.
