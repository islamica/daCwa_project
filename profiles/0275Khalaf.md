BIO: According to the sources we have he is sent to @@al-Rayy@@ [U:RAYY_515E356N_S] by @@`Abd All~ah al-'Akbar@@ [U:0270AbdullahAkbar] himself with the mission of converting @@al-^S_i`_iy_un@@ in North-West @@'_Ir_an@@ [U:al-Jibāl]

 He establishes himself in one of the villages around @@al-Rayy@@ [U:RAYY_515E356N_S], @@Kul_in@@. According to @@Ni*z_am al-Mulk@@’s (NOURI) @@Siy_asat N_amih@@ he says to his disciples that his was the doctrine of the House of the Prophet, which must, however, be kept secret until the appearance of @@al-Q_a'im@@, when it would be manifested. The appearance of @@al-Q_a'im@@ was near; it was, therefore, necessary to receive instruction, so that when he appears one should not be found ignorant of the doctrine. After he is overheard preaching by men of his village and the subsequent distrust towards him, he decides to flee to @@al-Rayy@@ [U:RAYY_515E356N_S] where he dies. His name continues to live on as @@al-'Ism_a`_il_iya=t@@ of the province become also known as @@al-_Halaf_iya=t@@. [@stern_early_1960]
