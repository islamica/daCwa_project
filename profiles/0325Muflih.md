BIO: He is a @@*gul_am?u*n@@ of @@Y_usuf?u bn?u 'Ab_i al-S_aj?i@@, who conquers @@Rayy?u@@ in @@_D_u al-Qa`da=t?i@@ of 311AH. When @@Y_usuf?u bn?u 'Ab_i al-S_aj?i@@ leaves for @@Hama_d_an?u@@ in 312AH he leaves @@Mufli*h?u*n@@ in his place. However, he seems to have antagonized the people with the result that he abandons the post and rejoins @@Y_usuf?u bn?u 'Ab_i al-S_aj?i@@. When in 317AH @@Y_usuf?u bn?u 'Ab_i al-S_aj?i@@’s nephew, @@'Ab_u al-Mus_afir?i Fat*h?u*n@@, is killed, he establishes himself as an independent ruler in @@'_A_darbayj_an?u@@. In 319AH he is making war on the Byzantines and in 320AH he strikes coins in @@'Ardab_il?u@@. In that same year he apparently has to flee from @@'_A_darbayj_an?u@@ from a certain @@Baldawayh?i@@ and seeks refuge with @@Yaz_id?u@@, the ruler of @@^Sarw_an?u@@, but who surrenders him to his enemy. However, his name is mentioned on coins from @@'_A_darbayj_an?u@@ and @@Barda`a=t?u@@ in the year 323AH, so he must have succeeded in overcoming these difficulties. Already one year before that, in 322AH his court becomes @@'Ab_u *H_atim?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@’s refuge who has to flee from @@Rayy?u@@. It is said that he succeeds in converting @@Mufli*h?u*n@@, the exact extent of his belief in the @@'ism_a`_il_iy?u*n@@ doctrines we can’t know though. @@'Ab_u *H_atim?i*n al-R_az_iy?u@@ dies shortly after at the court of @@Mufli*h?u*n@@. #Stern
