BIO: He is a @@*gul_am@@ of @@Y_usuf bn 'Ab_i al-S_aj@@, who conquers @@al-Rayy@@ in @@_D_u al-Qa`da=t@@ of 311AH. When @@Y_usuf bn 'Ab_i al-S_aj@@ leaves for @@Hama_d_an@@ in 312AH he leaves @@Mufli*h@@ in his place. However, he seems to have antagonized the people with the result that he abandons the post and rejoins @@Y_usuf bn 'Ab_i al-S_aj@@. When in 317AH @@Y_usuf bn 'Ab_i al-S_aj@@’s nephew, @@'Ab_u al-Mus_afir Fat*h@@, is killed, he establishes himself as an independent ruler in @@'_A_darbayj_an@@. In 319AH he is making war on the Byzantines and in 320AH he strikes coins in @@'Ardab_il@@. In that same year he apparently has to flee from @@'_A_darbayj_an@@ from a certain @@Baldawayh@@ and seeks refuge with @@Yaz_id@@, the ruler of @@^Sarw_an@@, but who surrenders him to his enemy. However, his name is mentioned on coins from @@'_A_darbayj_an@@ and @@Barda`a=t@@ in the year 323AH, so he must have succeeded in overcoming these difficulties. Already one year before that, in 322AH his court becomes @@'Ab_u *H_atim al-R_az_i@@’s refuge who has to flee from @@al-Rayy@@. It is said that he succeeds in converting @@Mufli*h@@, the exact extent of his belief in the @@'ism_a`_il_i@@ doctrines we can’t know though. @@'Ab_u *H_atim al-R_az_i@@ dies shortly after at the court of @@Mufli*h@@.
