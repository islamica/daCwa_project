There they can stay for about another year with @@Ibn `Ayy_a^s@@, a disciple of @@'Ab_u `Al_i@@. In spring 292AH they continue on towards @@al-Ma*grib@@. On the way, close to @@al-*T_a*h_una=t@@, halfway between @@al-'Iskandar_iya=t@@ and Cyrenaica, they encounter berber tribes who rob them. In the fight @@'Ab_u al-`Abb_as@@’ face is wounded by a sword. The group stay for a while in @@*Tar_abulus@@ to wait for one of @@al-Mahd_i@@’s slaves who was sent back to @@Salam_iya=t@@ to bring the treasures that were left behind. @@'Ab_u al-`Abb_as@@ is sent ahead to @@al-Qayraw_an@@ though. However, the information about @@al-Mahd_i@@ and his followers travelling west made it already to @@al-Qayraw_an@@ and @@'Ab_u al-`Abb_as@@ is recognized and arrested upon entering the city in summer 292AH. Even under torture he repeats the claim that he was just a normal merchant, so his life is spared, and about one year later, on 11th @@Jum_ad/a al-'Awwal@@ of 293AH he is freed by rebelling troops who were rallied in order to defeat @@'Ab_u `Abd All~ah al-^S_i`_i@@ and the tribes of @@Kut_ama=t@@.
