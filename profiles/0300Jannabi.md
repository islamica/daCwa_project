BIO: @@al-Jann_ab_i@@ is the founder of the communities in the Gulf region. He is of Persian descent and originally comes from @@Jann_aba=t@@. After he marries into a converted family in @@al-Saw_ad@@ either @@*Hamd_an Qarma*t@@ or @@`Abd_an@@ makes him a @@d_a`?i*n@@. He goes back to his homeland and carries @@al-da`wa=t@@ to @@Jann_aba=t@@, @@S_in_iz@@, @@*Tawwaj@@ and @@Mahr_ub_an@@ as well as in the coast area of @@al-F_ars@@. He collects taxes from converts, but soon opposition arises. He has to flee and meets up with @@Qarma*t@@ who believes in his abilities and sends him with new support to @@al-Ba*hrayn@@. In 286AH he settles in @@al-Qa*t_if@@ and works as a flour merchant. His first followers are three brothers with the name of @@`Al_iy@@, @@*Hamd_an@@ and @@al-*Hasan bn Sanbar@@ and their families. Very soon he starts converting the bedouins outside the city and incites them to raids against the unbelievers. The first clan that joins @@al-Jann_ab_i@@ are the @@Ban_u al-'A*dba*t@@ from the tribe @@Kil_ab@@, a tribe that was cast out by the other tribes, following the promise of being in the first rank of the coming kingdom of God. In 286AH @@al-Jann_ab_i@@â€™s men occupy @@al-Qa*t_if@@, in 287AH they are spotted close to @@al-Ba*sra=t@@, their main interest is the oasis of @@Hajar@@ though on which they lay siege. In the close town of @@al-'A*hs_a'@@ he constructs a @@d_ar al-hijra=t@@ for the region, from where @@al-Jann_ab_iy@@ reigns like a prince. When the siege of @@Hajar@@ is still under way the alarmed caliph @@al-Mu`ta*did@@ has 2,000 men sent from @@al-Ba*sra=t@@ to the oases of @@al-Ba*hrayn@@ to regain control. However, at the end of @@Rajab@@ in 287AH they are defeated by @@al-'Ism_a`_il_iy_un@@. @@al-Jann_ab_i@@ has the allegedly 700 captives killed except for the commanding officer who is sent back to the caliph to @@Ba*gd_ad@@. Later in the same year @@Hajar@@ is taken and destroyed, and whoever decides not to convert has to flee. When the schism between the headquarters in @@Salam_iya=t@@ and @@al-Qarma*t_iy_un@@ happens, @@al-Jann_ab_i@@ and his @@jaz_ira=t@@ follow his mentors in @@al-Saw_ad@@; he has his opponent @@'Ab_u Zakar_iy_a' al-*Damm_am_i@@, a loyalist to @@al-F_a*tim_iy_un@@ killed. At the end of 299AH there is a raid on @@al-s_uq@@ of @@al-Ba*sra=t@@. In @@_D_u al-Qa`da=t@@ of 300AH @@al-Jann_ab_i@@ is murdered by one of his slaves, maybe as a result of @@al-Mahd_i@@ not appearing when @@al-Jann_ab_i@@ had prophesied so. One of his six sons follows as his succesor. [@halm_reich_1991]
