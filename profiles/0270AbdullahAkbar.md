BIO: He is the founder of the @@'ism_a`_il_i@@ teachings. He hails from the village @@Q_uraj al_`Abb_as@@ close to @@al-'Ahw_az@@ [U:AHWAZ_486E313N_S] and in the first half of the third @@hijr_i@@ century lives in @@`Askar Mukram@@ [U:ASKARMUKRAM_488E316N_S]. The author @@Ibn Riz_am@@ (NOURI) claims that he is the son of @@Maym_un al-Qadd_a*h@@ (NOURI), but which seems to be unlikely. After he starts proclaiming his teachings he has to flee from @@`Askar Mukram@@ [U:ASKARMUKRAM_488E316N_S] and together with one of his followers, @@al-*Husayn al-'Ahw_az_i@@ (NOURI), takes residence in @@al-Ba*sra=t@@ [U:BASRA_477E304N_S]. He lives with clients of the family of @@`Aq_il bn 'Ab_i *T_alib@@ (NOURI) from the @@Ban_u B_ahila=t@@ and tells them that he is a descendent from @@`Aq_il@@ (NOURI), claiming to belong to @@al-H_a^sim_iy_un@@, the house of the prophet. However, when he still proclaims his teachings publicly the people from @@`Askar Mukram@@ [U:ASKARMUKRAM_488E316N_S] hear of it and @@`Abd All~ah@@ and @@al-*Husayn al-'Ahw_az_i@@ (NOURI) have to flee again, this time to @@Salam_iya=t@@ [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S]. There he succesfully disguises himself as a merchant from @@al-Ba*sra=t@@ [U:BASRA_477E304N_S] and finally has a respectable mansion built from where he resides as @@al-*Hujja=t@@ and that shall become the center of @@al-da`wa=t@@ for the forseeable future. He gets married in @@^S_al_us@@ [U:SHALUS_514E366N_S], one of the early areas of the mission. Other areas where his missionaries are sent, are the town of @@al-Rayy@@ [U:RAYY_515E356N_S], where @@_Halaf@@ [U:0275Khalaf] starts an @@'ism_a`_il_i@@ community, and @@al-Saw_ad@@ in the countryside of @@al-K_ufa=t@@ [U:KUFA_443E320N_S], where @@`Abd All~ah@@ sends one of his early loyal followers, @@al-*Husayn al-'Ahw_az_i@@ (NOURI), in 261AH or 264AH. The cell in @@al-`Ir_aq@@

 doesnâ€™t communicate directly with @@Salam_iya=t@@ [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S] though, but through @@*Talaq_an@@ [U:TALAQAN_508E361N_R]. His exact date of death is unknown, but he leaves two sons, @@'Ibr_ah_im@@ (NOURI) and @@'A*hmad@@ (NOURI), the latter of which becomes his successor. His grave is not known, but @@al-F_a*tim_iy_un@@ later build @@Maq_am al-'Im_am@@ in @@Salam_iya=t@@ [U:SALAMIYYA_370E350N_S] that is still revered as his resting place today. [@halm_reich_1991]
